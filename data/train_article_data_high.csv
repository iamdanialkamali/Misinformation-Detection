0,﻿snes-00223,A Harvard study proved that unvaccinated children pose no risks to other kids.,"Immunologist destroys mandatory vaccine logic in open letter
Dear Legislator:
My name is Tetyana Obukhanych.  I hold a PhD in Immunology.  I am writing this letter in the hope that it will correct several common misperceptions about vaccines in order to help you formulate a fair and balanced understanding that is supported by accepted vaccine theory and new scientific findings.
Do unvaccinated children pose a higher threat to the public than the vaccinated?
It is often stated that those who choose not to vaccinate their children for reasons of conscience endanger the rest of the public, and this is the rationale behind most of the legislation to end vaccine exemptions currently being considered by federal and state legislators country-wide.  You should be aware that the nature of protection afforded by many modern vaccines – and that includes most of the vaccines recommended by the CDC for children – is not consistent with such a statement.  I have outlined below the recommended vaccines that cannot prevent transmission of disease either because they are not designed to prevent the transmission of infection (rather, they are intended to prevent disease symptoms), or because they are for non-communicable diseases.  People who have not received the vaccines mentioned below pose no higher threat to the general public than those who have, implying that discrimination against non-immunized children in a public school setting may not be warranted.
IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) cannot prevent transmission of poliovirus (see appendix for the scientific study, Item #1). Wild poliovirus has been non-existent in the USA for at least two decades. Even if wild poliovirus were to be re-imported by travel, vaccinating for polio with IPV cannot affect the safety of public spaces.  Please note that wild poliovirus eradication is attributed to the use of a different vaccine, OPV or oral poliovirus vaccine.  Despite being capable of preventing wild poliovirus transmission, use of OPV was phased out long ago in the USA and replaced with IPV due to safety concerns.
Tetanus is not a contagious disease, but rather acquired from deep-puncture wounds contaminated with C. tetani spores. Vaccinating for tetanus (via the DTaP combination vaccine) cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is intended to render personal protection only.
While intended to prevent the disease-causing effects of the diphtheria toxin, the diphtheria toxoid vaccine (also contained in the DTaP vaccine) is not designed to prevent colonization and transmission of C. diphtheriae. Vaccinating for diphtheria cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is likewise intended for personal protection only.
The acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine (the final element of the DTaP combined vaccine), now in use in the USA, replaced the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the late 1990s, which was followed by an unprecedented resurgence of whooping cough. An experiment with deliberate pertussis infection in primates revealed that the aP vaccine is not capable of preventing colonization and transmission of B. pertussis (see appendix for the scientific study, Item #2). The FDA has issued a warning regarding this crucial finding.[1]
Furthermore, the 2013 meeting of the Board of Scientific Counselors at the CDC revealed additional alarming data that pertussis variants (PRN-negative strains) currently circulating in the USA acquired a selective advantage to infect those who are up-to-date for their DTaP boosters (see appendix for the CDC document, Item #3), meaning that people who are up-to-date are more likely to be infected, and thus contagious, than people who are not vaccinated.
Among numerous types of H. influenzae, the Hib vaccine covers only type b. Despite its sole intention to reduce symptomatic and asymptomatic (disease-less) Hib carriage, the introduction of the Hib vaccine has inadvertently shifted strain dominance towards other types of H. influenzae (types a through f).These types have been causing invasive disease of high severity and increasing incidence in adults in the era of Hib vaccination of children (see appendix for the scientific study, Item #4).  The general population is more vulnerable to the invasive disease now than it was prior to the start of the Hib vaccination campaign.  Discriminating against children who are not vaccinated for Hib does not make any scientific sense in the era of non-type b H. influenzae disease.
Hepatitis B is a blood-borne virus. It does not spread in a community setting, especially among children who are unlikely to engage in high-risk behaviors, such as needle sharing or sex. Vaccinating children for hepatitis B cannot significantly alter the safety of public spaces.  Further, school admission is not prohibited for children who are chronic hepatitis B carriers.  To prohibit school admission for those who are simply unvaccinated – and do not even carry hepatitis B – would constitute unreasonable and illogical discrimination.
In summary, a person who is not vaccinated with IPV, DTaP, HepB, and Hib vaccines due to reasons of conscience poses no extra danger to the public than a person who is.  No discrimination is warranted.
How often do serious vaccine adverse events happen?
It is often stated that vaccination rarely leads to serious adverse events.  Unfortunately, this statement is not supported by science.  A recent study done in Ontario, Canada, established that vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment (see appendix for a scientific study, Item #5).
When the risk of an adverse event requiring an ER visit after well-baby vaccinations is demonstrably so high, vaccination must remain a choice for parents, who may understandably be unwilling to assume this immediate risk in order to protect their children from diseases that are generally considered mild or that their children may never be exposed to.
Can discrimination against families who oppose vaccines for reasons of conscience prevent future disease outbreaks of communicable viral diseases, such as measles?
Measles research scientists have for a long time been aware of the “measles paradox.” I quote from the article by Poland & Jacobson (1994) “Failure to Reach the Goal of Measles Elimination: Apparent Paradox of Measles Infections in Immunized Persons.” Arch Intern Med 154:1815-1820:
“The apparent paradox is that as measles immunization rates rise to high levels in a population, measles becomes a disease of immunized persons.”[2]
Further research determined that behind the “measles paradox” is a fraction of the population called low vaccine responders.  Low-responders are those who respond poorly to the first dose of the measles vaccine.  These individuals then mount a weak immune response to subsequent RE-vaccination and quickly return to the pool of “susceptibles’’ within 2-5 years, despite being fully vaccinated.[3]
Re-vaccination cannot correct low-responsiveness: it appears to be an immunogenetic trait.[4]  The proportion of low-responders among children was estimated to be 4.7% in the USA.[5]
Studies of measles outbreaks in Quebec, Canada, and China attest that outbreaks of measles still happen, even when vaccination compliance is in the highest bracket (95-97% or even 99%, see appendix for scientific studies, Items #6&7). This is because even in high vaccine responders, vaccine-induced antibodies wane over time.  Vaccine immunity does not equal life-long immunity acquired after natural exposure.
It has been documented that vaccinated persons who develop breakthrough measles are contagious.  In fact, two major measles outbreaks in 2011 (in Quebec, Canada, and in New York, NY) were re-imported by previously vaccinated individuals.[6]–[7]
Taken together, these data make it apparent that elimination of vaccine exemptions, currently only utilized by a small percentage of families anyway, will neither solve the problem of disease resurgence nor prevent re-importation and outbreaks of previously eliminated diseases.
Is discrimination against conscientious vaccine objectors the only practical solution?
The majority of measles cases in recent US outbreaks (including the recent Disneyland outbreak) are adults and very young babies, whereas, in the pre-vaccination era, measles occurred mainly between the ages 1 and 15.  Natural exposure to measles was followed by lifelong immunity from re-infection, whereas vaccine immunity wanes over time, leaving adults unprotected by their childhood shots.  Measles is more dangerous for infants and for adults than for school-aged children.
Despite high chances of exposure in the pre-vaccination era, measles practically never happened in babies much younger than one year of age due to the robust maternal immunity transfer mechanism.  The vulnerability of very young babies to measles today is the direct outcome of the prolonged mass vaccination campaign of the past, during which their mothers, themselves vaccinated in their childhood, were not able to experience measles naturally at a safe school age and establish the lifelong immunity that would also be transferred to their babies and protect them from measles for the first year of life.
Luckily, a therapeutic backup exists to mimic now-eroded maternal immunity.  Infants, as well as other vulnerable or immunocompromised individuals, are eligible to receive immunoglobulin, a potentially life-saving measure that supplies antibodies directed against the virus to prevent or ameliorate disease upon exposure (see appendix, Item #8).
In summary: 1) due to the properties of modern vaccines, non-vaccinated individuals pose no greater risk of transmission of polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and numerous non-type b H. influenza strains than vaccinated individuals do, non-vaccinated individuals pose virtually no danger of transmission of hepatitis B in a school setting, and tetanus is not transmissible at all; 2) there is a significantly elevated risk of emergency room visits after childhood vaccination appointments attesting that vaccination is  not risk-free; 3) outbreaks of measles cannot be entirely prevented even if we had nearly perfect vaccination compliance; and 4) an effective method of preventing measles and other viral diseases in vaccine-ineligible infants and the immunocompromised, immunoglobulin, is available for those who may be exposed to these diseases.
Taken together, these four facts make it clear that discrimination in a public school setting against children who are not vaccinated for reasons of conscience is completely unwarranted as the vaccine status of conscientious objectors poses no undue public health risk.

Michigan residents lost their ""right to farm"" this week thanks to a new ruling by the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live, the news changes ""effectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals.""
Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigan's Right to Farm Act. The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock.
Kim White, who raises chickens and rabbits, said, ""They don't want us little guys feeding ourselves. They want us to go all to the big farms. They want to do away with small farms and I believe that is what's motivating it.""
The ruling will allow local governments to arbitrarily ban goats, chickens and beehives on any property where there are 13 homes within one eighth mile or a residence within 250 feet of the property, according to Michigan Public Radio.
The Right to Farm Act was created in 1981 to protect farmers from the complaints of people from the city who moved to the country and then attempted to make it more urban with anti-farming ordinances. The new changes affect residents of rural Michigan too. It is not simply an urban or suburban concern.
Shady Grove Farm in Gwinn, Michigan is the six and a half acre home to 150 egg-laying hens that provide eggs to a local co-op and a local restaurant. The small Michigan farm also homes sheep for wool and a few turkeys and meat chickens to provide fresh healthy, local poultry.
""We produce food with integrity,"" Randy Buchler told The Blaze about Shady Grove Farm. ""Everything we do here is 100 percent natural - we like to say it's beyond organic.
We take a lot of pride and care in what we're doing here."" Shady Grove Farm was doing its part to bring healthy, local, organic food to the tables of Gwinn residents, and it mirrors the attitudes of hundreds of other small farming operations in Michigan and thousands of others popping up around the nation.
The ruling comes within days of a report by The World Health Organization that stated the world is currently in grave danger of entering a post-antibiotic era. The WHO's director-general Dr. Margaret Chan argued that the antibiotic use in our industrialized food supply is the worst offender adding to the global crisis.
""The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan - public demand for access to more local, healthy, sustainable food,"" Gail Philbin told MLive.
Meanwhile, neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation.
Yesterday, the USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced massive funding to support research about small and medium-sized family farms, such as small farms ability to build-up local and regional economic systems. ""There's a lot of unnecessary legal action being taken against small farms who are doing good things in their communities,"" said Randy Buchler, who is also on the board of directors for the Michigan Small Farm Council.
The Michigan Small Farm Council  actively fought to support Michigan farming freedom, but ultimately the Commission voted to approve the new restrictions.
""Farm Bureau has become another special interest beholden to big business and out of touch with small farmers, and constitutional and property rights of the little guy,"" Pine Hallow Farms wrote to the Michigan Small Farm Council.
The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes. Matthew Kapp, government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau, told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances. The Farm Bureau did not feel Michigan's Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms, and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed.

[Image] Calgary City council is again considering fluoride in Calgary's tap water after studies show more cavities in Calgary children. PHOTO BY GAVIN YOUNG /Postmedia
When our twin sons were born in 1997, the City of Calgary had been adding one part per million of fluoride to our drinking water, which began in 1991.
Back then, health officials declared that the “science was settled” and I, like many other Calgarians, stupidly and unthinkingly believed their earnest declarations that adding fluoride to our water supply was “a safe and effective way” to battle tooth decay.
Two years later, those same medical experts let out a collective scientific oops. It was a quiet oops but one nonetheless, and naturally none of those arrogant medical experts was held accountable for their mistake. Calgary decided to decrease the amount of fluoride in our water to 0.7 ppm — a 30 per cent drop. Clearly, the science from just two years earlier wasn’t so settled after all. The experts were wrong by a whopping one-third. That should give all proponents of mass fluoridation pause.
By then, however, it was too late for my sons, both of whom have evidence of dental fluorosis on their permanent teeth — white chalky-looking spots — which is an indication that their bones have also been weakened as well as their teeth by this so-called safe and effective cavity-preventing additive to our water.
I can feel myself flushing with anger as I write this. Needless to say, my deference to the medical establishment with regard to the safety and effectiveness of fluoride in our water supply was pulled out by the roots and turned on its crown when I realized my children had been harmed by this anti-choice policy. As I’ve written before, I’ve done a lot of research since and if I had the money and the time, I would have sued those medical experts for the damage they inflicted on my kids.
As a parent, I did everything right when it came to our children’s dental health. My husband and I are very intentional parents. When our kids were young they either drank milk or water. No pop and almost no juice. They ate no junk. We used children’s toothpaste, with lower levels of fluoride, and we monitored their teeth brushing, applying the recommended pea-sized amount of children’s toothpaste to their toothbrushes in the morning and before bed. Nevertheless, those damned spots are proof positive that they received too much fluoride.
How is that possible? Because unlike most drugs — and yes, fluoride is defined as a drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — where a doctor prescribes the dose and frequency, it’s impossible to know how much fluoride a person is ingesting when it’s added to our water supply. Some people drink a lot of water, others very little. Some people are large, others, like children and babies, are small.
Speaking of babies and fluoride, in 2006 the American Dental Association recommended that parents not prepare baby formula with fluoridated water, something that the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. continues to recommend. Even though I tried to mostly nurse, we supplemented with formula made with fluoridated water for our sons. I sure wish I knew about that settled science when my boys were infants, but it came nine years too late.
One of the main arguments made for fluoridating our water is to prevent cavities in underprivileged children. Some parents, apparently, can’t afford a tube of toothpaste. I just checked, and there are 150 mL tubes of fluoridated toothpaste on sale for 69 cents. Buying bottled water to make powdered formula would cost considerably more, and the science shows that underprivileged women are much more likely to bottle feed their babies than other women.
Next Wednesday at 1 p.m., the City of Calgary’s community and protective services committee will receive a report of new evidence on the merits of fluoridation gathered by the University of Calgary’s O’Brien Institute for Public Health. It’s expected that the report will be submitted sometime this week for public review. Next Wednesday, members of the public will be given an opportunity to speak to the committee on this issue.
The main reason fluoride was removed from Calgary’s drinking water in 2011 was because council was being asked to upgrade the fluoride-adding equipment at Calgary’s Glenmore and Bearspaw water treatment facilities. That was expected to cost up to $6 million, not including the $750,000 annual operating cost. Thankfully, council voted against continuing the costly practice of medicating our water.
Oh, and as for that settled science, numerous reports published since Calgary removed fluoride from our water indicates that too much fluoride is linked to lower IQs in children exposed in utero, cognitive issues, kidney problems, endocrine failure, and the list goes on.
In February, Dr. William Ghali, of the O’Brien Institute, told council that the debate over fluoridation requires balancing individual rights and collective protections, drawing comparisons to vaccinations and cellphone use while driving. Here’s hoping he does some deeper thinking in his report than that faulty logic.
Obviously, adding fluoride to our water supply is not at all like driving while using a cellphone. No one must use a phone while driving or even must be vaccinated (though it’s highly recommended). Those are choices.
All of us, however, must consume water. We would die without it.
There is no such thing as Calgary residents having a tap for fluoridated water and non-fluoridated water. Those who choose to not drink or bathe in fluoridated water will have no choice at all should fluoride be added to our water supply again.

[Image] Calgary City council is again considering fluoride in Calgary's tap water after studies show more cavities in Calgary children.
When our twin sons were born in 1997, the City of Calgary had been adding one part per million of fluoride to our drinking water, which began in 1991.
Back then, health officials declared that the “science was settled” and I, like many other Calgarians, stupidly and unthinkingly believed their earnest declarations that adding fluoride to our water supply was “a safe and effective way” to battle tooth decay.
By then, however, it was too late for my sons, both of whom have evidence of dental fluorosis on their permanent teeth — white chalky-looking spots — which is an indication that their bones have also been weakened as well as their teeth by this so-called safe and effective cavity-preventing additive to our water.
Needless to say, my deference to the medical establishment with regard to the safety and effectiveness of fluoride in our water supply was pulled out by the roots and turned on its crown when I realized my children had been harmed by this anti-choice policy.
One of the main arguments made for fluoridating our water is to prevent cavities in underprivileged children.
Next Wednesday at 1 p.m., the City of Calgary’s community and protective services committee will receive a report of new evidence on the merits of fluoridation gathered by the University of Calgary’s O’Brien Institute for Public Health.
Oh, and as for that settled science, numerous reports published since Calgary removed fluoride from our water indicates that too much fluoride is linked to lower IQs in children exposed in utero, cognitive issues, kidney problems, endocrine failure, and the list goes on.
Obviously, adding fluoride to our water supply is not at all like driving while using a cellphone.
Those who choose to not drink or bathe in fluoridated water will have no choice at all should fluoride be added to our water supply again.","Scientific studies demonstrate that the process of adding fluoride to public water reduces the IQ of the individuals in those areas. </s> When our twin sons were born in 1997, the City of Calgary had been adding one part per million of fluoride to our drinking water, which began in 1991.

Did a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions?
According to the FDA's online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.
These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.

Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.
What's in Tripedia?
According to the Tripedia's package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.
What is the content of these two growth mediums?
Mueller and Miller medium contains:
Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.
While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:
Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.
The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.
""Probable cause"" ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG-an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.

Sucralose was approved for use in foods as a sweetener in 1998. Before approving sucralose, the FDA claimed to have reviewed 110 human and animal studies, but it turns out that only 2 out of those studies were actually on humans.
""It is a chlorinated artificial sweetener in line with aspartame and saccharin, and with detrimental health effects to match,"" explains Dr. Joseph Mercola.
Let's look as some of the potential health risks associated to Splenda. Reported symptoms: Seizures, Dizziness, Migraines, Allergic reactions, Weight gain and increases in blood sugar, Blurred vision, Gastrointestinal issues.
The reason it is so important to know about the effects of sucralose is because it is the number one selling artificial sweetener in America today. Most of the controversy surrounding Splenda is the way it is advertised. ""The sugar industry is currently suing McNeil Nutritionals for implying that Splenda is a natural form of sugar with no calories,"" Mercola adds.
What is sucralose really?
The truth is that sucralose does start off as sugar, but it is what happens after that is the problem. In the factory, three chlorine molecules are added to the sugar molecule to make sucralose.

What does this word mean? Dhimmitude
The word ""Dhimmitude"" is found in the new health care bill. So what does it mean? Obama used it in the health care bill. Now isn't this interesting? It is also included in the health care law.
Dhimmitude. I had never heard the word until now, so I typed it into Google and started reading. Pretty interesting! It's on Page 107 of the Obama healthcare bill. I looked this up on Google and, yep, it exists.....it is a REAL word.
Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslin populations conquered through jihad (Holy War). Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presenceAND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam!
ObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States!
Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured! Islam considers insurance to be ""gambling,"" ""risk-taking,"" and ""usury"" and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this.
How convenient. So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de-facto government insurance.
Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude.
American citizens need to know about it...... Every non-Muslim in the United States of America needs to know about it.

ObamaCare discriminates against Christians and Jews by denying them special exemptions extended to other religions.
If you are a mainstream Christian or a Jew, you need not apply to Opt Out of ObamaCare; that exemption is reserved for Muslims, Scientologists, Amish, Christian Scientists and Native American Indians who have a ""conscientious objection"" to insurance. A conscientious objection to theft committed by rouge politicians under the color of law with the threat of violence for non-compliance isn't sufficient in America today to exempt average Americans from the stranglehold of government. Believe it or not, if you are a Muslim you may claim a special religious exemption to Obama-Care that is denied to main-stream Christians and Jews. Or if you prefer a New-Age religion to Islam, you may become a Scientologist and Opt Out of ObamaCare's mandatory purchase of health insurance. Or, if you happen to be of Native American Indian extraction you too can opt out of the insurance laws by which everyone else in America must abide.","religion or ideology </s> ingroup vs. outgroup </s> anger </s> politicizing health issues </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> uppercase words </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> Call to action </s> emotional appeals </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility",false,"Muslims in the U.S. are specifically exempted from legislative requirements to purchase health insurance. </s> What does this word mean?

By Sarah Knapton, SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT
The bodies of thousands of aborted and miscarried babies were incinerated as clinical waste, with some even used to heat hospitals, an investigation has found.
Ten NHS trusts have admitted burning foetal remains alongside other rubbish while two others used the bodies in 'waste-to-energy' plants which generate power for heat.
Last night the Department of Health issued an instant ban on the practice which health minister Dr Dan Poulter branded 'totally unacceptable.'
At least 15,500 foetal remains were incinerated by 27 NHS trusts over the last two years alone, Channel 4's Dispatches discovered.
The programme, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose children in early pregnancy were often treated without compassion and were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains
One of the country's leading hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks gestation at their own 'waste to energy' plant. The mothers were told the remains had been 'cremated.'
Another 'waste to energy' facility at Ipswich Hospital, operated by a private contractor, incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011 and 2013.
They were brought in from another hospital before being burned, generating energy for the hospital site. Ipswich Hospital itself disposes of remains by cremation.
""This practice is totally unacceptable,"" said Dr Poulter.
""While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay.""
Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, has written to all NHS trusts to tell them the practice must stop.
The Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has also written to the Human Tissue Authority to ask them make sure that guidance is clear.
And the Care Quality Commission said it would investigate the programme's findings.
Prof Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: ""I am disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their families.
""This breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use services and I'm keen for Dispatches to share their evidence with us.
""We scrutinise information of concern and can inspect unannounced, if required.""
A total of one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, while NHS figures show there are around 4,000 stillbirths each year in the UK, or 11 each day.
Ipswich Hospital Trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal remains from another hospital had been incinerated on its site.
A spokeswoman said: ""The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust does not incinerate foetal remains.""
She added that the trust ""takes great care over foetal remains""
A spokesman for the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said that trained health professionals discuss the options with parents 'both verbally and in writing.'
""The parents are given exactly the same choice on the disposal of foetal remains as for a stillborn child and their personal wishes are respected,"" they added.

Dear Friends,
My name is Antonia Foraker from Delight, WV.
My youngest daughter, Savannah, was diagnosed with a rare blood disease in January of 2000.
Savannah, who will turn four on February 29, is a bright, happy young girl who likes watching Sesame Street and playing with her two older sisters.
Unfortunately, there isn't much doctors can do for her right now.
Our medical costs have become extremely expensive.
Three local companies have promised to give $.05 each for every time this email is forwarded.
If you wouldn't mind forwarding this to everyone on your list I would greatly appreciate it as well as my daughter.
Your good deeds could really save her life.
Please take a few seconds to help us in our time of need.
I know how many of these go around and I want you to know that they really help, if you would like to contact us, our e-mail address is: <foraker0401@yahoo.com>
Please have a heart and forward this.
Thank you,
The Forakers

19,﻿snes-00782,Was a Russian Woman 'Embalmed Alive' with a 'Formalin Drip'?,"Russian woman, 27, dies in excruciating agony after she was 'embalmed alive' with a formaldehyde-based drip instead of being put on saline in a horrific medical blunder
A 27 year old woman has died in excruciating agony after she was embalmed alive due to a horrific medical blunder.
Ekaterina Fedyaeva's mother has accused medics of 'murder' after they put her daughter on a formalin drip - a solution contain formaldehyde - instead of saline.
The woman had been in hospital in her home city of Ulyanovsk in Russia for routine surgery.
She was given a drip normally infused into the veins of the dead to prevent decomposition.
Ekaterina suffered horrible pains and convulsions for two days before falling into a coma.
She was attached to a life support machine and her heart stopped several times.
After being flown to a top Moscow hospital, she woke up from her coma - but finally died of multiple organ failure.
Her mother Galina Baryshnikova and husband Igor were with her when she came round from the surgery in her ward.
'Her legs were moving, she had convulsions, her whole body was shaking,' said her mother.
'I put socks on her, then a robe, then a blanket but she was shivering to such an extent, I can't even describe it.
'No doctor came to see her although she was coming round from anaesthetic.'
She suffered chronic stomach pains and vomiting.
The bereaved mother said: 'We had no idea it was formalin.
'And they knew very well that they washed up her body with a poison - and they did nothing to help...
'Now I understand that formalin was simply eroding her body from inside.
'People who performed the surgery already knew that they infused something wrong.
'They needed to take some urgent measures - but they did nothing.'
She begged doctors to help - but they told her to go home, cook chicken soup and stop worrying.
'I begged - 'please help her, she is my only child',' said Galina.
'I think they just wanted me to go away and to hide everything.'
Overnight Ekaterina was rushed to intensive care as her condition deteriorated.
'For 14 hours after surgery she was living with this formalin and they did nothing,' she said.
What is formaldehyde and how is it dangerous to humans?
Formaldehyde was declared a carcinogen by the US government in 2011 but is widely used as part of  embalming fluid to preserve dead bodies.    
Formalin, made up of around 37 per cent formaldehyde, is a colourless, strong-smelling chemical substance used in industry and well known to preserve human corpses.  
Embalmers inject at least 11.3 litres of the fluid into the cadaver's arterial system and body cavity to slow decay for burial ceremonies.
Drinking 30 milliliters of formalin can kill an adult, while drinking doses of concentrated formaldehyde can cause death from respiratory failure or lead to a coma.
It can also cause convulsions, stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, vertigo and a host of other side effects.

20,﻿tron-01420,FDA Warning About Certain Jars of Peter Pan Peanut Butter,"FDA Update on Salmonella Outbreak Linked to All Peter Pan Peanut Butter and Certain Lot Numbers of Great Value Brand Peanut Butter
Feb 26, 2007
Product testing by several states has now confirmed that Peter Pan peanut butter and certain Great Value brand peanut butter are the sources of the foodborne illness outbreak of Salmonella Tennessee that began in Aug. 2006. To date 329 individuals have become ill from consuming the contaminated peanut butter, and 51 of those persons were hospitalized.
The outbreak is ongoing. All products containing Peter Pan brand peanut butter and all jars of Great Value brand peanut butter bearing a product code that begins 2111 are potentially contaminated. Potentially contaminated products include 3/4-oz. and 1.1-oz single serving packs of Peter Pan brand peanut butter. All of these products contain peanut butter that was manufactured in ConAgras Sylvester, GA plant. Retailers and institutions possessing the products described should not serve or sell them. Any consumer possessing any of these products should discard them.
Symptoms of foodborne illness caused by Salmonella include fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. In persons with poor underlying health or weakened immune systems, salmonella can invade the bloodstream and cause life-threatening infections. Individuals who have recently eaten any products containing Peter Pan peanut butter or Great Value brand peanut butter from a jar bearing a product code beginning 2111 and who have experienced any of these symptoms should contact their doctor or health care provider immediately and report the illnesses to their state or local health authorities. Similarly, institutional food establishments and other food service providers who have received reports of illness from consumers after they consumed one of these products are encouraged to share that information with their local health department.
ConAgra has recalled these products from stores and ceased production in their Sylvester, GA processing plant until the exact cause of contamination can be identified and eliminated. FDA is continuing to work closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and with states and local officials to identify how the contamination occurred in order to prevent similar foodborne illness outbreaks.

We have to admit that travelling in AC cars can also be at cancer risk. Car interiors contain toxic levels of cancer-causing benzene emitted by dashboards, car seats, and air fresheners, and recommends opening windows to expel trapped benzene gas before turning on the car air conditioner. 

Please do NOT turn on A/C as soon as you enter the car. Open the windows after you enter your car and turn ON the air-conditioning after a couple of minutes. A research says the car dashboard, sofa, air freshener emit Benzene, a Cancer causing toxin. In addition to causing cancer, Benzene poisons your bones, causes anemia and reduces white blood cells. Prolonged exposure will cause Leukemia, increasing the risk of cancer
A car parked indoors with windows closed will only contain 400-800 mg of Benzene. If parked outdoors under the sun at a temperature above 60 degrees F, the Benzene level goes up to 2000-4000 mg, 40 times the acceptable level...People who get into the car, keeping windows closed are certain to inhale excessive amounts of the toxin.

Dandelion has been used medicinally since ancient times for its various health benefits. However, the most powerful benefit to come out of this common weed is something that medical researchers are super excited to have ""discovered"" - which is its potential to cure cancer!
This potent root builds up blood and immune system- cures prostate, lung, and other cancers better than chemotherapy. According to Dr. Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario, Canada, dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This form of cancer typically affects older adults.
John Di Carlo, who at the time was a 72-year old cancer patient at the hospital, was sent home to live out his final days after all efforts failed to treat his leukemia. He told CBC News that he was advised to drink dandelion root tea as a last ditch effort. Perhaps it should have been the first option offered in his treatment plan, as his cancer went into remission only four months later! His doctors attributed this to the dandelion tea that he drank.
Recent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very quickly on cancer cells, as was evidenced in Di Carlo's case. Within 48 hours of coming into contact with the extract, cancerous cells begin to disintegrate. The body happily replaces these with healthy new cells.
Further studies have concluded that the extract also has anti-cancer benefits for other types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, liver, and lung cancer! Dandelion root tea may not taste as pleasant as other teas, but it's certainly more pleasant than living with the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatments.
Traditional cancer therapies harm the immune system by killing all cells, even the healthy ones. Dandelion root has the opposite effect - it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells. It's definitely a win-win situation!
Dr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy. It's always best to consult with your doctor, and let them know any and all supplements or foods that you are consuming on a regular basis.
Even if you don't have cancer, eating the greens or drinking dandelion tea can still give you great health! For example, the roots and stems of dandelion can help fight diabetes. It does this by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin, which in turn stabilizes the spikes in blood sugar levels.
If you suffer from digestive issues or need to get rid of toxins, dandelion tea may be just what the herbal medicine doctor ordered! The liver aids the digestive system by producing bile, and it also filters the blood of chemicals and other impurities. According to Dr. Axe, the vitamins and minerals found in dandelions can help cleanse the liver and keep it in tip top shape. So by supporting your liver, you are actually creating better health!
Dandelions are also high in antioxidants and vitamin C, which is crucial to helping your body fight off infections, such as the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections. If you suffer from frequent bouts of UTI, drinking dandelion tea on a daily basis may prevent it from happening ever again.
Dandelion greens are bitter, but completely edible - as long as you get it from an area that hasn't been sprayed with chemicals. The greens are rich in fiber, which is great for intestinal health! High fiber diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.
The greens are also high in vitamin A - just one cup contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance. Vitamin A is critical for maintaining healthy vision, and it can also prevent premature aging of the skin.
Since you probably aren't likely to eat an entire cup of bitter greens on its own, you can incorporate it into a morning smoothie. Just blend it up with your favorite fruit, which will offset the bitter taste.

26,﻿snes-01533,PETA is releasing Lone Star Ticks into the northeastern United States in order to give people original,"Surge in red meat allergies in the US is a bizarre side effect of TICK BITES
A growing number of Americans are at risk for becoming allergic to red meat as ticks proliferate and spread across the country. 
A special task force of experts has said that there are 'more cases identified each year,' and estimated that more than 3,500 people had the allergy by 2016.
As much as 80 percent of people with meat allergies had also been bitten by a lone star tick, according to the first study to establish the connection. 
Scientists have predicted that 2017 could be a very bad year for tick bites - and with them, meat allergies. 
[Image of a hand and meat in the background] 
People with allergies to red meat often develop the reaction after being bitten by lone star ticks, which are becoming increasingly common in the US

People with red meat allergies may break out in a rash or hives, all sick to their stomachs, sneeze, develop asthma or a headaches, or even go into anaphylactic shock and stop breathing.  
Red meat allergies are immune responses to a carbohydrate called alpha-gal (short for galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose). 
Alpha-gal is an antibody found in the cells of most mammals, but not in primates - including humans. 
The ticks themselves aren't actually carry alpha-gal antibodies genetically, either. 
But deer do. 
Deer are one of a tick's favorite animals to feed off. Like pigs and cattle, deer carry the alpha-gal antibodies. 
When a tick latches on to a deer as an appetizer before moving on to bite a human, it carries leftover alpha-gal with it, sometimes transferring to the antibody it picked up from the deer to people. 
Once a person has contracted alpha-gal, the body develops the allergic reaction to red meat, a misplaced immunological message that we are not supposed to eat it. 
There is no cure for the allergy. Only first identified in 2009, little is known about red meat allergies, including its exact prevalence.   
Alpha-gal allergies mostly cause reactions to red meats, like beef, pork and venison, and occasionally to poultry. 
It usually takes around four hours for an alpha-gal allergic reaction to set in after a person eats meat. 
[Image of map - where lone star ticks are most prevalent] 
Red meat allergies are thought to be caused by lone star ticks, which live predominantly in the Eastern US, but are reportedly growing in number and spreading around the country 

Lone star ticks are found across a wide swath of the US, stretching from Maine at the country's Northeastern tip, westward and down to Texas's southern tail. 
Back in May, scientists predicted a red-letter year for ticks in New Jersey and the Northeast. 
[Image of Lonestar tick] 
Lone star ticks, so called for the white spot on their backs, are on the rise in the Northeastern US 

A combination of this year's unseasonably warm population and abundant mice populations (another favorite host for ticks) create perfect conditions for a variety of native ticks, including the lone star variety, to thrive. 
Lone star ticks can transmit a number of bacterial diseases, viral infections and rashes, as well as the alpha-gal allergy, and are known to be 'aggressive' parasites.
Because people with red meat allergies are particularly prone to going into sudden and severe anaphylactic shock, it is advisable to carry an EpiPen. 
Ticks typically live in forested areas with heavy ground cover, where they are hard to spot. The best ways to avoid contracting a meat allergy are to be sure to wear plenty of protective covering and insect repellent, or avoid these areas altogether.

28,﻿snes-06234,A virus deadly to dogs has been spreading in the canine population of the U.S.,"Deadly dog flu jumped from horses
HEALTH 27 September 2005
By Shaoni Bhattacharya
The deadly canine flu that has been making domestic dogs and racing greyhounds ill in the US jumped from horses in a ""very rare event"", say scientists.
Although the possibility that the virus could also jump to humans cannot be ruled out, scientists are urging calm. But researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta say they will be monitoring human exposure.
The flu affecting dogs is markedly different from human flu and the bird flu currently raging in Southeast Asia, which has infected and killed humans. The virus infecting canines is a type A influenza virus called H3N8. The name refers to the subtype of two proteins vital to the virus's life cycle, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The avian flu is also type A, but H5N1.
Researchers have now shown that the dog flu, which decimated racing greyhounds in Florida in January 2004 and has since spread across the east coast, originated in horses.
""We must keep in mind that this H3N8 equine influenza virus has been in horses for over 40 years. In all these years, we have never been able to document a single case of human infection,"" notes Ruben Donis, chief of molecular genetics for the influenza branch of the CDC, who led the study. ""That's not to say that there isn't any risk but at this point, there is no reason to panic.""
'Unprecedented' transfer
The study was prompted after Cynthia Crawford at the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, started investigating an outbreak of acute respiratory disease among racing greyhounds in the state in 2004. Genetic sequencing revealed that the virus was H3N8.
Phylogenetic analysis - tracing back the dog virus's recent evolutionary history - suggested that there was a single event where the entire virus jumped from a horse to a dog. It then spread horizontally through the dog population, suggests the team.
When the team checked archived samples of serum from sick greyhounds in Florida, they found antibodies to H3N8 as far back as 2000.
The researchers say viral transfer from horse to dog, followed by sustained transmission from dog to dog, is ""unprecedented"". In the current human cases of bird flu, the virus jumps from birds virtually unchanged but does not then cause infections in other people.
More usually, interspecies outbreaks begin either when a flu virus mutates, or when two strains swap genes after infecting the same host. That can produce a new virus, which then spreads through the host population.
Poorly pets
Between January and May 2005 there were respiratory disease outbreaks among about 20,000 greyhounds at 20 tracks in 11 states, from Arizona to Massachusetts. Samples from dogs at seven Florida tracks revealed they had been exposed to dog flu. It was also indicated in greyhounds in Arizona and one in Texas.
In a CDC briefing on Monday, Crawford said that between April and May 2005, the deadly flu had also crossed over to domestic dogs. But she noted that in 80% of dogs the disease is mild - with the animal having only a cough and runny nose.
However, as with human flu, in a minority of cases there may be complications and the dogs can develop pneumonia. The mortality rate is currently between 5% and 8%.
The team is urging anxious dog owners to take a commonsense approach. If their dog has had a respiratory illness it should be kept at home for two weeks, says Crawford, to let it recover and prevent other dogs becoming infected. But if a dog remains well, life should go on as normal.
For example, says Crawford: ""I am taking my two Pekinese to be groomed next week to a groomer that sees many dogs during the day.""
The team says work on a vaccine for the new dog flu has been under way for a few months.

29,﻿snes-00768,A new study published in the Lancet has officially declared that fluoride is a neurotoxin,"Fluoride Officially Classified As A Neurotoxin In World's Top Medical Journals
1 WEEK AGO
Evidence of how negatively fluoride can impact our health has been increasing in rapid pace throughout the past few years. People are hoping that by bringing awareness to this that somehow we can get sodium fluoride removed from the world's water supply.
A big step has been made here recently. In the most prestigious medical journal. One known as The Lancet. fluoride has been at last classified as a neurotoxin one hundred percent. This puts it in the same category as things like lead, arsenic, and mercury.
This news was released by the author Stefan Smyle who actually cited a report that had been published in The Lancet Neurology, Volume 13, Issue 3 to be exact in the March of 2014 edition. In this, the authors stated that many more of these neurotoxins remain undiscovered throughout the world. They noted that many children are now being affected by neurodevelopmental disabilities caused by these neurotoxins. These authors have found that while fluoride in our water supplies is a major cause an issue there is another major cause as well, fluoride can actually also be found in heavily processed brands of tea that are grown in most likely overly polluted areas.

Most parents have been avoiding fluoridated toothpaste altogether and are jumping on the natural bandwagon in order to help ensure their families safety. A good natural go-to brand is known as Earthpaste for those who may not be aware of it. If you want to get away from fluoridated toothpaste I suggest using it or making your own. I will include a video at the end on how to make natural fluoride free toothpaste.
Fluoride and Cancer
Fluoride is added to our water supply throughout North America but in most other countries fluoride is banned. Why is this? Because fluoride is extremely dangerous for our health. Fluoride in our drinking water has been linked to many different kinds of cancer.

The British Columbia Health Ministry recently admitted that tissues from aborted fetuses are part of the “biomedical waste” that it regularly sends to an American plant that turns the waste into electricity for Oregon-area residents.
Unnamed officials with the agency’s communications unit sent an email to B.C. Catholic admitting that “biomedical waste [which includes] human tissue, such as surgically removed cancerous tissue, amputated limbs and fetal tissue [is] disposed of through appropriate contacted providers,” The Blaze reported.
“Some is transferred to Oregon [where it’s] incinerated in a waste-to-energy plant,” the email continued. The agency also assured that the tissues and wastes are processed and handled in line with “health and safety protocols, as well as federal, provincial and local regulations.”
LifeSiteNews.com reported that the executive director of the Oregon Refuse and Recyling Association said to B.C. Catholic that the waste is likely deposited at the Covanta Marion plant — and the plant, meanwhile, confirmed it still receives and incinerates waste that comes from the medical community.

32,﻿snes-01190,"Did a CDC Doctor Say the Flu Shot Is Causing a Deadly Outbreak? 
Original","CDC Doctor: 'Disastrous' Flu Shot Is Causing Deadly Flu Outbreak
By BAXTER DMITRY January 17, 2018

A CDC doctor has warned this year's ""disastrous"" flu shot may be responsible for the deadly flu epidemic sweeping the country.

""Some of the patients I've administered the flu shot to this year have died,"" the doctor said, adding ""I don't care who you are, this scares the crap out of me.""

""We have seen people dying across the country of the flu, and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot.""

Scientists were worried this year's flu season was going to be rough and their fears have been proven well founded. The flu season is off to a record-breaking start, with the CDC reporting widespread flu activity from coast to coast. Many health officials believe that 2018 will ultimately be the worst flu outbreak that we have experienced since 1918.

The CDC doctor's experience of patients dying of the flu after receiving the flu shot is sadly not uncommon. Eight Santa Barbara County residents have died from the flu in the last fortnight. Seven of them had the flu shot.

This deadly pattern is replicating itself across the country. Yet health officials are still telling people to get the flu shot, even though it does not work well this season. Officials have started admitting that the vaccine it is only 10% effective.

The verdict is out on flu shots. Many medical experts now agree it is more important to protect yourself and your family from the flu vaccine than the flu itself.

Every year the pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media work hard to convince us to get vaccinated against the flu. 2018 is no different. But, as usual, we're not being told the whole story.

Pharmaceutical companies provide mainstream media outlets with a huge percentage of their advertising revenue. Big pharmaceutical companies actually spend far more on advertising than research. We are talking hundreds of billions of dollars.

Big Pharma's dollars have effectively purchased the silence of mainstream media. You can no longer believe anything they say about pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines.

It is clear Big Pharma is desperate to ensure mainstream media outlets never tell us about adverse reactions or the toxic chemicals being injected into us in the flu shot.

Flu vaccines contain dangerous ingredients

The pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media admit to us that flu vaccines contain strains of the flu virus. What they are less likely to reveal though is the long list of other ingredients that come with the vaccine.
It is now a known fact that flu vaccines contain mercury, a heavy metal known to be hazardous for human health. Mercury toxicity can cause depression, memory loss, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory problems, ADD, oral health problems, digestive imbalances and other serious health issues.

The flu vaccines actually do not immunize but sensitize the body against the virus

Have you ever noticed how vaccinated children get sick almost immediately following a vaccination?

This is because the flu virus is introduced into their bodies. So rather than immunize, the flu shot actually only sensitizes the body against the virus.

And the fact that it causes individuals to get ill following a shot indicates immuno-suppression (i.e. lowering of the immunity).

Makes you more susceptible to pneumonia and other contagious diseases

For someone with an already suppressed immune system, injecting strains of the flu virus can have devastating consequences.

If your body is already working to fight off a virus or simply operating with low immunity, a vaccine injection could put your body in serious danger of contracting influenza with stronger symptoms, or even worse pneumonia and other contagious diseases.

Weakens immunological responses

There have been literally thousands of medical journal articles published that show injecting vaccines can lead to harmful immunological responses and a host of other infections. Moreover, weak immunological responses only decrease a person's ability to fight the diseases that the vaccine was supposed to protect against in the first place.

Serious neurological disorders

Evidence now suggests that ingredients in flu vaccinations can actually cause serious neurological disorders. In 1976 a significant number of those who received the flu vaccine acquired Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a disorder characterized by permanent nerve damage and even paralysis.

Flu vaccines can contain many harmful materials including detergent, mercury, formaldehyde, and strains of live flu virus.

Should you get a flu shot? If you are still prevaricating, and wondering who to trust, consider this: The very people pushing flu vaccinations, and putting the fear of God into anybody who abstains, are making billions of dollars each year.

Are they the people we should be trusting with our health?

In August 1999, the Committee on Government Reform initiated an investigation into Federal vaccine policy. This investigation focused on possible conflicts of interest on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The investigation concluded that many individuals serving on two key advisory committees had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines.

Often, these individuals were granted waivers to fully participate in the discussions that led to recommendations on vaccine licensing and adding vaccines to the Childhood Immunization Schedule.

This in itself creates serious doubt as to how effective flu vaccines really are.

This year's mission, run and sponsored by the Moran Eye Center from the University of Utah, will take Paul to Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.
""We kind of suggested it,"" said Paul in an interview. ""There was talk about Haiti being in great need, and it's fairly close to the United States. Haiti, unfortunately, is famous for a long history of problems.""
In 2014, Paul joined the Moran center on a similar trip to Guatemala, where he reunited with old patients and broke out his rusty, Texas-tutored Spanish. He has no similar connection to Haiti.

""You want to go where the need is greatest,"" Paul said. ""In our country, when you have cataracts, they're relatively easy to fix. The people we will treat in Haiti -- many of them will be completely blind. There's less medical access there. It's closer to the equator. There's more sun, people are outside more, fewer people even have sunglasses. So there's a lot you can do.""
Paul's 2014 trip was balanced against a small media frenzy. Multiple media outlets traveled with him, filming his journey and surgeries for profiles of a likely presidential contender. David Bossie of the conservative Citizens United even brought a film crew -- complete with aerial drone -- to capture the scene.
Citizens United has not yet made use of that footage, and the entourage will be smaller in Haiti. (The Washington Post will be part of it.) ""The main thing is for me personally is that it's one of the most incredible things I get to be involved with,"" said. ""It's still the most important thing I get to do, even while I'm in the Senate, even running for president. Two hundred people will be better because we are going to be down there. Local surgeons will get some training, and they'll use that training. The goal is not for Americans to keep coming down and doing it, but for Haitians to do more of it themselves.""
Paul was staying clear of politics, but he was making a point that jibed with his own views of foreign aid. Training people, then trusting them to build their own lives, was always better than constant intervention. Paul cited the example of Sanduk Ruit, a Nepalese doctor who designed a simplified kind of cataract surgery, because he had to work ""without sophisticated equipment"" -- and in the process, did something a Western doctor would never have thought to do.
""In medicine, you're transferring skills,"" said Paul. ""Even when you train, you're learning skills. I will continue doing this throughout my life, and at some point I can foresee getting back into medicine full time. It's nice to get away from politics, and do something were you and act there's an immediate result. You take the bandages off, and someone can see.""",politicizing health issues </s> political figures or political argument,true,"Rand Paul's Summer Break Eye Surgeries </s> Rand Paul leaves the campaign trail for eye surgeries in Haiti

35,﻿tron-01803,Doctors Expose Zika Virus Hoax,"10 Reasons Why Zika Virus Fear Is Another Fraudulent Medical Hoax And Jab Industry Funding Scam
ALEXANDER LIGHTJUNE 6, 2016
Think the Zika virus is responsible for all the cases of microcephaly in South America? Think again: There is no reliable scientific evidence linking the two.
by Mike Adams
The developmental deformities are actually caused by <b> exposure to toxic insecticide and larvicide chemicals <b>, not Zika virus. (Source: Brain Deformations Caused by Larvicide Chemical Linked to Monsanto)
But because Zika virus fear fits a convenient funding narrative for chemical giants and jjab manufacturers, it is being played up by the corrupt, criminally-run CDC and the Obama administration to <b> funnel billions of dollars into the hands of jjab corporations <b> while ignoring the real causes of microcephaly.
Here are the top 10 reasons why the Zika virus fear mongering is a total scam:
#1) The microcephaly cases (shrunken heads) in Brazil were caused by larvicide chemicals, not by zika
A group of doctors from South America are now saying the brain deformations the world is witnessing are caused by the mass fumigation of low-income Brazilian people with a chemical larvicide, not by mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus.
From the doctors at Red Universitaria de Ambiente y Salud (the Red University of Environment and Health):
A dramatic increase of congenital malformations, especially microcephaly in newborns, was detected and quickly linked to the Zika virus by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
However, they fail to recognise that in the area where most sick persons live, a chemical larvicide producing malformations in mosquitoes has been applied for 18 months, and that this poison (pyroproxyfen) is applied by the State on drinking water used by the affected population.
Read more on the subject here.
#2) Even according to the CDC, which is aggressively pushing false Zika fear, nearly all Zika infections are harmless, symptomless and require no hospitalization whatsoever
From the CDC's Zika page:
Most people infected with Zika virus won't even know they have the disease because they won't have symptoms... The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. People usually don't get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika.
For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected... Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections.
In other words, Zika infections are no big deal, and nearly everyone self-immunizes against Zika even after they have been infected. So much for the urgent fear for a new jjab, eh?
#3) The CDC fabricated the science linking Zika to microcephaly
By the way, the CDC is totally fabricating its claim that all cases of microcephaly are caused by Zika virus.
This proclamation by the CDC was based on complete fiction, just like everything else the CDC claims about Bird Flu, Swine Flu and even the number of people who die from influenza each year (the CDC claims 35,000, but it's a completely fabricated number).
Remember, the CDC is a criminal organization tied to the financial interests of Big Pharma. It funds researchers like Poul Thorsen who had to flee the country and is now a fugitive from justice. Like all the other fraudsters at the CDC, he worked on jjab ""research"" too.
From this report:
CDC researcher Poul Thorsen, who famously headed up the ""Denmark Study"" that many claim disproved any link between autism and jjabs, has been indicted in Atlanta by a federal grand jury on charges of wire fraud, money laundering and defrauding research institutions of grant money.
Poul Thorson is a scientist who formerly worked for the CDC, and over the last several years, he oversaw millions of dollars in grant money that was used to conduct research to ""prove"" that jjabs have no link to autism.
Dr. Thorson's research papers include the famous ""Danish Study"" entitled Thimerosal and the occurrence of autism: negative ecological evidence from Danish population-based data. ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12949291) 
#4) Zika virus fear was just used by Congress to remove bans on other toxic pesticide chemicals that cause cancer and Alzheimer's disease
From this article:
The House of Representatives voted Tuesday to loosen already weak pesticide regulations in a purported effort to combat the spread of the Zika virus. The latest version of the bill is called the Zika Control Act.
They argue it will remove important protections instated by the Clean Water Act. If the legislation becomes law, pesticide applicators will be allowed to dump pesticides into bodies of water without a permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They will not have to report the contamination, either.
Congresswoman Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.) said that adding more pesticides to water would threaten pregnant women - the same group the GOP claims to be protecting from Zika.
In other words, the Zika virus hype is a <b>conspiracy to legalize the dumping of more toxic chemicals into the environment by powerful chemical companies.<b>
#5) Zika virus hype was also invoked by Obama to funnel another $1.8 billion to the jjab industry, claiming anyone who opposed the funding ""opposed pregnant women""
It always comes down to money, doesn't it? All the Zika hype and fear is being used to take more money from taxpayers and funnel it into the pockets of jjab / pharma corporations.
From Natural News:
President Obama proposed to Congress that a total of $1.8 billion be dedicated to fighting Zika. This massive investment may be nothing more than tilting at windmills...
#6) Zika virus fear has been used as a weapon of control to terrorize the people of the Americas by violating their private property
Governments in South America are invoking the Zika virus to nullify private property rights. This is totalitarianism via medical hoax!
From this article:
The latest act of political terrorism on the illusory world stage is yet another alleged disease epidemic - this time the ""Zika Virus,"" which officials are warning (just like they did with Ebola) might turn into a global pandemic.
And the martial law pandemonium has already begun in Brazil, where government officials have now declared that they can ""legally"" break and enter into people's homes and private property, if it's suspected that Zika-harboring mosquitoes might be living there.
Reuters is reporting that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has given the official green light to ""authorized health officials"" to violate personal property rights in order to address the alleged threat, which has been dubbed an ""imminent danger to public health.""
As long as a property is either abandoned or the owners are not present, government officials can literally break in and enter people's homes without warrant or just cause.
#7) Zika is just the latest viral hoax floated by governments... remember the great Bird Flu hoax that sold billions in jjabs?
Spreading fear about viruses is so effective that the governments and health ""authorities"" of the world roll out the same scam every few years... and people fall for it every time!
Remember the great Swine Flu hoax? Also from this 2010 report:
The great swine flu hoax of 2009 is now falling apart at the seams as one country after another unloads hundreds of millions of doses of unused swine flu jjabs.
No informed person wants the injection anymore, and the entire fear-based campaign to promote the jjabs has now been exposed as outright quackery and propaganda.
Even doctors are now calling the pandemic a complete hoax. As reported on FoxNews, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, a leading health authority in Europe, says that drug companies ""organized a 'campaign of panic' to put pressure on the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic.
He believes it is 'one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century,' and he has called for an inquiry.""
#8) Zika virus fear is being used to justify the release of genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild
Not only does Zika fear allow governments to funnel money to jjab companies and legalize more chemical insecticides; it also justifies their release of genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild (with unknown future consequences).
It's all part of the total destruction of the ecosystem that has been systematically planned and carried out by the globalists governments of the world.
What you're NOT being told is that the epicenter of the Zika virus spread is precisely where GM mosquitoes were released last year. Via this article:
Oxitec, a company that calls itself ""... a pioneer in controlling insects that spread disease and damage crops,"" unveiled its GM mosquito farm in Brazil in July 2012. Its goal was to reduce dengue fever, a disease which is spread by the Aedes mosquitoes which also spread the Zika virus.
Then, in 2015, these GM mosquitoes were released into the wild in Brazil. In July that same year, the release was declared a success by the company, who noted that they'd been able to control the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads dengue fever, chikungunya ... and the Zika virus.
However, in October, people in the general area where the mosquitoes were released began to experience illnesses related to the Zika virus at alarmingly fast rates.
#9) Zika fear is being used to justify spraying MORE of the very chemicals that are causing the shrunken heads in the first place, putting even more children at risk
Now that Zika fear is being hyped up by the corrupt, scientifically illiterate mainstream media, most people just stand aside as governments throughout the Americas <b> spray all sorts of toxic, deadly chemicals all over the place. <b>
Now the new mantra for chemical pollution is, ""It's for Zika!"" and then everybody backs off. It's almost like ""playing the Zika card"" to justify almost anything.
Right now, the Obama administration could unleash a nuclear holocaust across America and claim, ""The radiation is to stop Zika!"" and everybody would just go along with it (because they're totally obedient to false authority).
#10) It's the PERFECT MEDICAL SCAM: Spraying more chemicals will cause more deformed babies, resulting in an even greater cry for more jjabs and more chemical spraying... and the cycle repeats
The most shocking realization in all this is that the mass spraying of chemicals, the release of GM mosquitoes, and the use of Zika jjabs will all <b> spread Zika even faster. <b>
It's the perfect medical scam! Zika is spread by the very things that we're all told are trying to stop Zika, and as the problem gets worse, all the chemical spraying and jjabs get ramped up to insane levels, causing even more insane levels of Zika virus.
It's just like flu shots: They spread the flu, causing more influenza outbreaks, panicking more people into getting more flu shots.
And the cycle repeats. It's the greatest medical scam of all time: <b> Make sure the treatments CAUSE the problem they claim to prevent! <b>
Why do you think chemotherapy causes cancer? Why do you think antidepressant drugs cause depression? Why do you think flu shots spread the flu?
It's all by design, folks. And Zika is just the latest chapter of this massive <b> quack science scam <b> being carried out as global medical theater to control the masses.

36,﻿tron-02217,ALS Association Supports Embryonic Stem Cell Research,"Catholics warned to mind ALS donations after flood of ice bucket challenges
Ice Bucket fundraiser raises concerns about embryonic stem-cell research in some dioceses. 
By Hannan Adely , Jeff Green and Abbott Koloff The Record (Hackensack, N.J.)
[Image] 
Image caption: “Tara Villalobos of Richfield, Wis., dumped a bucket of ice water onto a participant of the fundraising challenge.”
The Newark, N.J., Roman Catholic Archdiocese has told pastors and Catholic school officials that holding Ice Bucket Challenges — the popular fad that has raised millions of dollars to combat a crippling illness ALS — conflicts with church teachings by funding embryonic stem-cell research.
The warning was issued in a letter from a church official and with the blessing of Archbishop John J. Myers. It said some of the research funded by the ALS Association, which receives much of the money from the Ice Bucket Challenge, involves embryonic stem-cell research, which is opposed by the Catholic Church because of conflicts with its stance against abortion.
The challenge involves dumping ice water on participants’ heads and donating money for research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The Rev. Lawrence Fama, director of the archdiocesan Office of Respect Life, called the challenge “a stunt” that can be “fun and engaging,” but questioned whether the practice conflicts with “Catholic moral teaching.”
Newark is one of just a few dioceses across the nation that have issued advisories about the Ice Bucket Challenge, which has become a social media sensation.
The archdiocese sent the letter Thursday to principals at all 94 Catholic schools in the archdiocese, and to pastors and religious education staff at 218 parishes. It suggested sending donations to organizations that don’t use embryonic stem-cell research.
The ALS Association responded to the warnings with a statement saying it primarily funds adult stem-cell research, which is not opposed by the Catholic Church. The statement went on to say that the association is funding one study that uses embryonic stem cells, and that research is funded by “one specific donor who is committed to this area of research.”
“In fact, donors may stipulate that their funds not be invested in this study or any stem-cell project,” the statement said.
It was unclear what effect the archdiocese’s letter would have. Catholic schools won’t be back in session for another week and a half. Pastors were sent the letters for informational purposes, said archdiocesan spokesman Jim Goodness, but it’s up to them to decide how or whether they will share that information with parishioners.
Embryonic stem-cell research does not rank as a major issue for most Catholics. In a 2009 Gallup survey, 63 percent of Catholics said embryonic stem-cell research was “morally acceptable.”
Last September, Pope Francis said church leaders had become too focused on social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion and had strayed from their pastoral mission of helping the poor.
Goodness said the guidance regarding donations to ALS does not conflict with the pope’s message, and merely tells people to be aware of potential conflicts with Catholic teaching.
Raul Caceres, a Teaneck parishioner who has campaigned against lavish upgrades to Myers’ future retirement home, said the letter is an example of the archdiocese defying the wishes of Pope Francis.
Caceres, a surgeon, said he disagrees with church teaching on the issue of embryonic stem-cell research. “I’m a doctor; how could I oppose that?” he said.

Newark is one of just a few dioceses across the nation that have issued advisories about the Ice Bucket Challenge, which has become a social media sensation.
It suggested sending donations to organizations that don’t use embryonic stem-cell research.
The ALS Association responded to the warnings with a statement saying it primarily funds adult stem-cell research, which is not opposed by the Catholic Church.
The statement went on to say that the association is funding one study that uses embryonic stem cells, and that research is funded by “one specific donor who is committed to this area of research.”
Embryonic stem-cell research does not rank as a major issue for most Catholics.
In a 2009 Gallup survey, 63 percent of Catholics said embryonic stem-cell research was “morally acceptable.”
Goodness said the guidance regarding donations to ALS does not conflict with the pope’s message, and merely tells people to be aware of potential conflicts with Catholic teaching.
Caceres, a surgeon, said he disagrees with church teaching on the issue of embryonic stem-cell research. </s> Narrative with Details </s> politicizing health issues </s> Narrative with details_details verified to be true </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified"
37,﻿snes-02126,"In May 2017, Pinnacle Foods announced the ""largest recall in recent times"" of several Aunt Jemima products due to possible Listeria contamination.","ALERT: Largest RECALL In Recent Times ANNOUNCED- EVERYONE Has This In Their Freezer And It Can KILL YOU
A New Jersey-based food company is recalling Aunt Jemima frozen pancakes, waffles and French toast because they could be contaminated with Listeria.
Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. An estimated 1,600 people get listeriosis each year, and about 260 die. The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and their newborns, adults aged 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems.
Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

38,﻿snes-03067,Warren Buffett proposed a constitutional amendment that seeks to require laws apply equally to U.S. citizens and members of Congress.,"Actual content - 
Warren Buffett is asking everyone to forward this email to a minimum of 20 people, and to ask each of those to do likewise. In three days, most people in the United States will have the message. This is an idea that should be passed around.

For too long we have been too complacent about the workings of Congress. Many citizens had no idea that Congressmembers could retire with the same pay after only one term, that they didn't pay into Social Security, that they specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment) while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from the Healthcare Reform that is being considered - in all of its forms.
Somehow, that doesn't seem logical. We do not have an elite that is above the law. I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever. The self-serving must stop. This is a good way to do that. It is an idea whose time has come.
Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:
""Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States.""
Each person contact a minimum of Twenty people on their Address list, in turn ask each of those to do likewise.
Then in three days, all people in The United States of America will have the Message. This is one proposal that really should be passed around.
This is a great idea. Only need 3/4 of the State Legislatures to pass this to become law... AND IT IS VETO PROOF including no appeal to the Supreme Court.
Let's get this passed around - Congress has brought this upon themselves!!!

39,﻿snes-05648,"Hyland's Teething Tablets have been discontinued for causing ""adverse events"" in children.","Teething tablets may be linked to 10 children's deaths, FDA says
By Jen Christensen and Jamie Gumbrecht, CNN
Updated 12:48 PM EDT, Thu October 13, 2016
CNN - 
Ten deaths of children who used homeopathic teething tablets and 400 adverse events associated with the tablets have been reported to the <a> US Food and Drug Administration,<a> the agency said Wednesday.
The FDA warned caregivers to stop using the products, which parents use to soothe teething babies, and to take their child to a doctor immediately if the child experiences problems.
The agency is investigating the adverse events and the cases involving the deaths, as ""the relationship of these deaths to the homeopathic teething products has not yet been determined and is currently under review,"" according to a statement.
The deaths and adverse events - including fever, lethargy, vomiting, sleepiness, tremors, shortness of breath, irritability and agitation - occurred over the past six years.
In an emailed statement, Hyland's, a maker of homeopathic teething tablets and gel, said, ""Hyland's has not been made aware of any data that supports the claims in the warning against our teething tablets and gels. Our understanding is that the Food and Drug Administration's investigation of these products is still ongoing. The fact is that we have not been made aware of any medical or statistical evidence to support a causal link between homeopathic teething tablets and adverse outcomes at this point. We continue to request any available information and statistics from the FDA.""
Hyland's said this week that it will stop distributing the products in the United States.
The company said in a letter posted on its website Tuesday that it chose to discontinue US distribution of its teething products.
""This decision was made in light of the recent warning issued by the Food & Drug Administration against the use of homeopathic teething tablets and gels. This warning has created confusion among parents and limited access to the medicines,"" the letter from <a>Hyland's employees said<a>. ""Putting you in a position of having to choose who to trust in the face of contradictory information is burdensome and undermines the FDA.""
There is no recall on the products, including Hyland's Baby Teething Tablets, Hyland's Baby Teething Tablets Nighttime and Hyland's Baby Teething Gel. CVS, one of the drugstore chains that sold Hyland's, Baby Orajel Naturals and its own version of the teething products, <a> pulled all of them from the shelves after the FDA warning <a>. Walgreens also confirmed that it has withdrawn homeopathic teething products that were subject to this FDA warning.
""We are confident that any available Hyland's teething products, including those you already have, are safe for use,"" the Hyland's letter said. ""Of course, parents who may have concerns should consult with their physicians before using any medicines, read labels carefully and follow all instructions.
""We look forward to the future of homeopathic medicines as we work in partnership with the FDA,"" the letter said.
The FDA issued <a> a safety alert about the tablets in 2010 <a>, and Hyland's issued a recall at that time. After lab testing, the FDA said it found <a> inconsistent amounts of belladonna <a> in the tablets. The agency also had reports of adverse events related to using the products that were consistent with belladonna toxicity. The FDA also was concerned because the bottles didn't have child-resistant caps.
Since 2010, Hyland's said, it reformulated the product to reduce the amount of belladonna and revamped its production process. ""We also improved our system to monitor, investigate and trend all safety reports on any of our products. We have not seen any trend to indicate that Hyland's teething medicines pose any risk to consumers,"" it said <a> on its website <a>.
The American Academy of Pediatrics' <a> HealthyChildren.org <a> has warned parents to stay away from teething tablets that contain belladonna and gels with benzocaine, citing the FDA warnings and the potential side effects.
Instead of teething tablets or gels, the <a>American Academy of Pediatrics suggests <a> that parents massage the child's gums with a clean finger when a baby is in pain; use a solid teething ring or clean, wet washcloth that's been chilled in the freezer; frozen bananas, berries or bagels.

Some companies that promise 100% parmesan cheese, have been adding cellulose, a common food additive made from wood pulp, to their cheese products, according to an independent study, launched by Bloomberg News.
An independent laboratory test found that products like Walmart store's Great Value 100% grated parmesan cheese registered 7.8% cellulose, Jewel-Osco’s Essential Everyday 100% parmesan cheese was 8.8% cellulose and Kraft had 3.8% cellulose, Bloomberg reported.
But, while the idea of eating a product that contains wood pulp doesn’t seem appetizing, you probably do it more than you think.
Cellulose, which is indigestible and present in all plant food, is many times added to food to give texture, according to John Coupland, a Pennsylvania State University professor of food science and president-elect of the Institute of Food Technologists.
Coupland said companies could use powdered cellulose from celery or broccoli in their products, but it would be a waste of food.
“It’s extracted and ground up like a powder, that doesn’t dissolve in water, and doesn’t taste like anything,” Coupland said.
The lack of taste is part of the reason it's found in many shredded cheese products.
“The powdered cellulose in shredded cheese prevents the cheese from sticking together and getting oily,” Coupland said.
The study comes in the wake of a drawn-out FDA investigation into Castle Cheese Inc., a company which falsely claimed to produce 100% parmesan cheese, but used a high percentage of cellulose and a mixture of other cheeses, duping customers.
After the FDA investigation, the company discontinued the products and filed for bankruptcy in 2014, Bloomberg notes.

43,﻿tron-01806,The Dangers of String or Hair on Baby Toes,"Parents warned of shocking syndrome that cuts off babies' circulation
This is toe-curling.
A Missouri mom is warning new parents to be vigilant after a strand of hair wrapped around her 5-month-old's toe acted as a tourniquet and cut off circulation for days.
Sara Ward, 33, told South West News Service that baby Logan could have lost the little piggy after the incident late last month.
Ward said she first noticed a line going across the middle toe of her son's right foot late one Saturday evening but ""didn't think much of it.""
""It wasn't looking alarming at that point and we figured maybe it had just got a little bit irritated by something,"" the mom recalled in an interview.
However, by Monday, Logan's toe was still swelling and had turned purple. Ward and her partner rushed to the pediatrician to see what was wrong.
The medic told them it was hair tourniquet syndrome: ""a rare clinical phenomenon that involves hair, thread, or similar material becoming so tightly wrapped around an appendage that it results in injury.""
Sara Ward shared this shocking photo of her son's toe after a strand of hair cut off circulation. The mom is warning of the dangers of hair tourniquet syndrome.Kennedy News and Media
The strand of hair that was wrapped around Logan's toe was so thin that doctors were worried they could not remove it without surgery.
""They spent a good 40 minutes or so trying to get the hair and they had all these different tools that they were using - tweezers, magnifying goggles and special lights,"" Ward recalled. ""The toe was very painful for my son so he was crying and kicking and couldn't keep still as they were trying to get a better look at it.""
The rattled mom continued: ""They tried hair removal cream to try and break down the hair pieces and some numbing cream to get deeper with tweezers.""
Doctors decided to keep Logan in the hospital overnight to monitor the toe and make sure the hair had been properly removed and that his circulation was restored.
The following day, Ward and her partner were relieved that the tot's toe had returned to a healthy pink color. They were able to be discharged without Logan having to undergo surgery.
However, she and other perturbed parents are determined to raise awareness about the dangers of hair tourniquet syndrome, so other moms and dads don't have to go through the same drama.
Registered nurse and postpartum care expert Karrie Lochner recently shared a message about what parents can do to prevent the issue.
""I think it's great to do a quick 'once-over' on your baby with each diaper change,"" she wrote. ""Undress them, rub your thumb along their fingers and toes, also taking a close look at their genitals (yep, even girls!).
""When these are seen, they need to be removed immediately,"" she added, mentioning in her stories that parents can use hair removal cream such as Nair or nail scissors to release the tourniquet. ""If the hair is embedded deeply into the appendage, and unable to be removed by the parents at home, please take baby to the hospital ASAP.
""A lot of people think 'It's just a piece of hair, how can you not see it and get it?' but it's really difficult with the swelling and the skin starts to kind of form over the hair,"" Ward explained. ""Now I'm always checking his toes and fingers now and making sure that I'm not seeing any hairs getting wrapped around them.
The incident took place just before the popular parenting page @tinyheartseducation warned of the syndrome on Instagram.
""While hair tourniquets are rare, they require quick recognition and treatment to prevent long-term damage to the body part,"" the account's owners wrote beneath a shocking social media post.
""They're most commonly seen on infants and toddlers due to their inability to tell us what is going on and where they have pain. Infants who are less than 4 months old are most at risk because 90% of mamas experience postpartum hair loss.""
The post garnered thousands of likes, with multiple moms flocking to the comments section to claim their kids had been victims of hair tourniquet syndrome.

46,﻿tron-01833,Dr. David Hager nominated for FDA panel,"Important - Women's Health Issue
Whether you're Right or Left on the issue of women's reproductive rights, please consider the following...
President Bush has announced his plan to select Dr. W. David Hager to head up the Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA) Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee. The committee has not met for more than two years, during which time its charter has lapsed. As a result, the Bush Administration is tasked
with filling all eleven positions with new members. This position does not require Congressional approval.

The FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee makes crucial decisions on matters relating to drugs used in the practice of obstetrics, gynecology and related specialties, including hormone therapy,
contraception, treatment for infertility, and medical alternatives to surgical procedures for sterilization
and pregnancy termination. Dr. Hager's views of reproductive health care are far outside the mainstream and a setback for reproductive technology.

Dr. Hager is a practicing OB/GYN who describes himself as ""pro-life"" and refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women. Hager is the author of ""As Jesus Cared for Women: Restoring Women Then and Now."" The book blends biblical accounts of Christ healing women with case studies from Hager's practice. In the book Dr. Hager wrote with his wife, entitled ""Stress and the Woman's Body,"" he suggests that women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome should seek help from reading the bible and praying. As an editor and contributing author of ""The Reproduction Revolution: A Christian Appraisal of Sexuality, Reproductive Technologies and the Family,"" Dr. Hager appears to have endorsed the medically inaccurate assertion that the common birth control pill is an abortifacient.

Hagar's mission is religiously motivated. He has an ardent interest in revoking approval for mifepristone
(formerly known as RU-486) as a safe and early form of medical abortion. Hagar recently assisted the Christian Medical Association in a ""citizen's petition"" which calls upon the FDA to revoke its approval of mifepristone in the name of women's health.

Hager's desire to overturn mifepristone's approval on religious grounds rather than scientific merit would
halt the development of mifepristone as a treatment for numerous medical conditions disproportionately
affecting women, including breast cancer, uterine cancer, uterine fibroid tumors, psychotic depression,
bipolar depression and Cushing's syndrome. Women rely on the FDA to ensure their access to safe and
effective drugs for reproductive health care including products that prevent pregnancy.

For some women, such as those with certain types of diabetes and those undergoing treatment for cancer,
pregnancy can be a life-threatening condition. We are concerned that Dr. Hager's strong religious beliefs may color his assessment of technologies that are necessary to protect women's lives or to preserve and promote women's health. Hager's track record of using religious beliefs to guide his medical decision-making makes him a dangerous and inappropriate candidate to serve as chair of this committee. Critical drug public policy and research must not be held hostage by antiabortion politics. Members of this important panel should be appointed on the basis of science and medicine, rather than politics and religion. American women deserve no less.

WHAT CAN YOU DO?
1. SEND THIS TO EVERY PERSON WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
2. OPPOSE THE PLACEMENT OF THIS MAN BY CONTACTING THE WHITE HOUSE AND TELL THEM HE IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE ON ANY LEVEL.

Please email President Bush at president@whitehouse.gov or call the White House at (202) 456-1111 or (202) 456-1414 and say ""I oppose the appointment of Dr. Hager to the FDA Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee.

Until last December, that is. The Ocean County man had gone to Florida for the winter, where he was beset by frequent hives accompanied by a ferocious itching ""four times worse than poison ivy.""
After enduring one misdiagnosis after another, Dotoli finally learned from a blood test that he had become allergic to meat, pork and dairy - the very allergens he'd been happily ingesting nearly every day.
And the culprit? Most likely a bite from <a> the Lone Star tick <a>.
""People are really blindsided when I tell them,"" he said. ""They say, 'Lyme disease, right?'""
The Lone Star tick is ""more of an annoyance than an important disease vector,"" said Tom Mather, director of the University of Rhode Island's <a> TickEncounter Resource Center. <a>
When it comes to dangerous illnesses, as opposed to allergies, the Lone Star can transmit a Lyme-like disease called <a> human ehrlichiosis, <a> but that strikes only three people out of a million, and is fatal only one percent of the time, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The tick does not transmit Lyme.
The allergy can become dangerous - triggering episodes of anaphylactic shock - if undiagnosed. There is no official count of how many people now suffer from the allergy, but allergists in different regions of the country each report cases in the hundreds.
The Lone Star is a very aggressive biter, and its bites typically come with a wicked itch - a telltale sign. The itch can last for weeks or even months.
While the female has the distinctive white dot that gives the species its name, the males are difficult to recognize and after often mistaken for the more feared ""deer tick.""
The Lone Star has become common in the southern part of New Jersey, especially along the eastern, coastal counties, Mather said. It is now the predominant tick on the eastern end of Long Island as well.
In New Jersey's higher elevations, it is less common, although its range is gradually expanding. ""They definitely keep prodding themselves a little bit north,"" Mather said.
Dotoli's allergy, called Alpha-gal (rhymes with ""pal""), can be hard for meat-lovers to recognize because beef and pork are so prevalent in their diets, said the allergy researcher who <a> played a major role in discovering it. <a>
""If you're allergic to shrimp, well, most people don't eat shrimp every day. So if you have a reaction to shrimp, you know it. People come in and tell us they're allergic to shrimp, and they're usually right,"" said <a> Thomas Platts-Mills <a>, of the University of Virginia School of Medicine.
This allergy can also elude detection because unlike most food allergies, it has a delayed onset. While a person allergic to peanuts will know something's amiss within 15 minutes of eating peanuts, someone with Alpha-gal won't sense any reaction at least two hours, with four or five hours being more common, he said.
In his research, Platts-Mills was able to see that the lab tests showing the unusual antibody triggering the allergy appeared only in a broad swath of the eastern and southern United States. That footprint had fairly distinct ""borders"" past which the allergy simply didn't exist.
The range of the Lone Star tick (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
That hinted at an environmental factor at play. After a few days of casting about on the internet, his technician hit upon a map showing the maximum range of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever - a tick-borne disease. It mirrored the Alpha-gal map almost exactly.
When Platts-Mills and his team took a closer look at patients in some of those states, they found the allergy present in people who seemingly led very different lives - from a socialite to an air-conditioning repairman. What proved to be the common link was lots of outdoor activity, he said: The socialite sponsored a fox hunt, the repairman was an avid hunter.
That implicated ticks, more specifically, the Lone Star tick.
It is unknown how many people suffer from the Alpha-gal allergy, although Platts-Mills said he has heard reports from Long Island allergists of 300 cases in that region alone.
In an odd twist of fate, Platts-Mills came down with the allergy himself after researching it - a development made evident to him when he broke out in hives six hours after eating some lamb chops in London.
Adapting to the allergy hasn't been difficult for him. ""My cardiologist doesn't want me to eat red meat anyway, so for me, it's not a problem,"" he said.
It has been a bigger adjustment for Dotoli, who now has a water bagel - not one made with milk - for breakfast, tuna or egg salad sandwich for lunch, and cashews or raisins for a snack.
""At night is the hard time. I'm eating a lot of eggplant with spaghetti sauce,"" he said. ""I have to be very careful with baked good, because some of them contain milk. So my jelly doughnuts are out the window.""
He said his heart goes out to children who come down with the allergy and have to learn to restrict their diets.
There is a small chance the allergy will disappear in about five years if Dotoli avoids further tick bites. So his daily ""tick check"" involves a full-length mirror for viewing his front and a hand-held mirror for his back.
That should help him avoid a worsening of the situation - although science is not yet clear on that point.
""We're 100 percent sure that tick bites can cause this,"" Platts-Mills said, while cautioning: ""But we're not 100 percent sure that they're the only cause.""

Original","California mom bitten by 'kissing bug' warns others about danger of 'silent killer' parasitic disease 
By Jennifer Earl , | Fox News
When Lynn Kaufer Hodson was bitten by a triatomine, also known as a ""kissing bug,"" she couldn't even feel it. It wasn't until a large, itchy lump appeared on her neck the next day that she realized some type of pest had sucked her blood.
Hodson had been staying with family in a camper on her ranch in Grass Valley, Calif., in November 2016 while she waited to move into her new home in Penn Valley - a town that was a roughly 30-minute drive away.
At first, Hodson just believed a spider or mosquito had bitten her while she was staying in a fifth wheel camper. But weeks went by, and the bite mark continued to throb and itch.
""It was super itchy for like two or three weeks,"" Hodson, 49, recalled to Fox News, though she admitted she initially decided against going to the doctor.
It wasn't until two months later that Hodson learned - by accident - the type of deadly bug that had actually bitten her.
In January 2017, Hodson decided to donate blood, as she routinely did once a quarter. Weeks later, the wife and mother received a shocking letter in the mail from the American Red Cross that revealed there were signs she had been infected with the rare parasite <i>Trypanosoma cruzi <i>, which triggers a dangerous illness called Chagas disease.
Hodson immediately underwent follow-up testing at the Center of Excellence for Chagas Disease at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, where doctors confirmed she had contracted Chagas.
The 49-year-old had to wait two months, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prioritized high risk patients such as pregnant women and those with AIDS, before she could get any medications to treat the infection.
""There is no urgency, no concern, no anything with this disease right now.""
- Lynn Kaufer Hodson
""They say if you get it treated right away research shows it's effective,"" Hodson said. ""What's right away? I had to wait five months, so how I looked at it was - I have it. It's either going to affect me or it's not.""
At least 8 million people have been infected with Chagas disease in Central and South America and Mexico, according to the CDC's most recent report in December 2017. And an estimated 300,000 Americans in the U.S. also have the illness, a recent news release from the American Heart Association shows.
However, Hodson said the disease is called the ""silent killer"" because many people don't show any symptoms. Therefore, she estimates the number of those infected to be even higher.

Kissing bugs spread the infection by biting a human, typically on their face (hence the nickname), and then defecating near the wound. The parasite can then get rubbed into the open wound or get into the body if someone touches their mouth or eyes afterward.
Chagas disease can cause life-threatening heart issues, including heart disease, strokes, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. About one-third of those infected will develop chronic heart disease, according to the AHA.
""There is no urgency, no concern, no anything with this disease right now. Not many people have it; it's not a sexy thing. You can't see it,"" Hodson said, explaining that she's hoping to ""put a face"" to the disease so others will take it seriously.
""It comes down to politics,"" she argued.
Hodson currently sees a cardiologist once a year for an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram. She also wears a Holter monitor for 48 hours after every check-up to monitor her heart activity. That's all she says she can do at the moment.
""I'm a total Type A control freak, but this is so beyond anyone's control. You can live your life stressed and worried about it or you can just live your life,"" Hodson said. ""Life is short.

Kate Ogg has an answer ready for the day her son Jamie asks who's older, he or his twin sister:
""Technically, you're two minutes older,"" she'll tell him, ""but Emily's been alive longer.""
Shortly after Jamie and Emily were born prematurely at 27 weeks on March 25, 2010, doctors told Ogg and her husband David that Jamie had died.  Nurses placed his limp body across his mother's bare chest so she could say goodbye.
But after five minutes, Jamie began to move. The baby's doctor told the Oggs his movements were reflexive and not a sign of life. But as his mother continued cuddling him, Jamie opened his eyes. Kate put some breast milk on her finger, and he eagerly accepted it. Their tiny baby grew stronger and stronger in his mother's arms, and their final goodbye turned into a hello.

Born prematurely at 27 weeks, twins Emily and Jamie made a dramatic entrance. Jamie was declared dead shortly after birth, but revived after cuddling skin-to-skin with his mother.TODAY / Today
""I'd carried him inside me for only six months - not long enough - but I wanted to meet him, and to hold him, and for him to know us,"" Kate Ogg told TODAY's Ann Curry in 2010. ""We'd resigned ourselves to the fact that we were going to lose him, and we were just trying to make the most of those last, precious moments.""
""We feel so fortunate,"" David Ogg told TODAY. ""We're the luckiest people in the world.""
[image] 
The Oggs' experience garnered international media attention and dramatically highlighted the benefits of parents holding newborns skin-to-skin on their bare chests, which is commonly called ""kangaroo care."" Though the medical benefits of skin-to-skin contact are well documented, it's still not encouraged, or even allowed, at many hospitals.
Jamie and Emily, now nearly 2, are doing great, Kate Ogg said in a Skype interview as she and her husband held the tow-headed toddlers on their laps. In November, the family moved from Sydney, Australia, to a home with an ocean view in Nelson, New Zealand, ""a very chilled-out town,"" she said.
The twins' last checkups showed they are developing completely normally, she said. To demonstrate, she asked, ""Where's your nose? Where are your ears?"" and the twins pointed to the correct body parts. ""Where's your belly?"" she asked, and the kids obediently lifted their shirts.
Soon after the twins' premature birth - and Jamie's revival - the Oggs promised themselves they wouldn't drive themselves crazy worrying about potential problems related to their children's prematurity. They'd enjoy their babies, and cross those bridges when they got to them. ""If there was a problem,"" Kate Ogg says they figured, ""we'd find out about it eventually.""
Still, Ogg and her husband think about Jamie's brush with death ""all the time. Probably too much,"" she said. She panics if the twins sleep in and she doesn't hear a sound from the nursery. ""I'm a bit too morbid, I think.""
Sharing their story publicly also led to some unintended emotional consequences. A Colorado woman told Ogg Jamie's story caused distress in a support group for parents who've lost babies. ""The portrayal of our story almost suggested if you love your baby enough you can bring it back to life. That's one of the concerns we had about going public.""
<b> Surprise! Their 'little sumo' <b>
As the spotlight faded, the Oggs returned to normal life as a happy family - and these days they have a new blessing to count.

52,﻿snes-02999,Studies have proved that having an abortion increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in American women, second only to skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2021, 281,550 American women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 43,600 American women will lose their lives to the disease. In spite of these statistics, many women are being kept in the dark about a preventable risk factor of breast cancer: abortion. Due to the politics surrounding abortion, many organizations are afraid to speak out about the link between abortion and breast cancer.
Is abortion a risk factor for breast cancer?
When a woman becomes pregnant her body begins to go through biological changes in order to prepare for childbirth. Increased levels of estrogen during pregnancy cause a woman's breasts to enlarge with cells that will eventually allow for milk production. By the time of a full-term birth these cells have differentiated into milk producing tissue and have stopped multiplying. These cells are resistant to cancer because they have been differentiated into a specific type of cell and the cell multiplication process has been stopped.
If a woman has an abortion before her 3rd trimester of pregnancy, her breasts are left with more undifferentiated cells that are more vulnerable to cancer than if she had never been pregnant.
What about miscarriages?
Researchers have found that most miscarriages don't raise the risk of breast cancer because these pregnancies don't produce enough estrogen, which is the driving factor behind the proliferation of undifferentiated, cancer-vulnerable cells.
What do the scientific studies show?
Fifty-eight out of 74 worldwide studies dating back to 1957 have shown that abortion increases a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. 19 of the 23 studies from the United States show that abortion is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. (1)
One study which appeared in the International Journal of Epidemiology in 1989 and relied on New York state medical records reported that abortion increased a woman's risk of getting breast cancer by 90%. (2)
In 1996, Dr. Joel Brind combined the statistics from 23 different worldwide studies and found a 30% increase of breast cancer risk among women who chose abortion after already giving birth and a 50% increase of breast cancer risk among women who chose abortion before giving birth. (3)
A study done on African-American women by researchers at Howard University showed that African-American women over 50 were almost 5 times more likely to get breast cancer if they had abortions compared with women who had never received an abortion. (4)
It is also universally recognized by experts that having a first full-term birth at an early age lowers a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Another study published in the Lancet found that breast feeding is another way women can lower their risk of breast cancer. (5) Women who abort their first pregnancy don't get the protective effects of a first full-term pregnancy and don't receive the protective effects of breast feeding.
Flawed study cited by pro-abortion organizations
Pro-abortion organizations often like to quote a study done on Danish women in an attempt to prove that abortion has no link to breast cancer. (6) This study was flawed in a couple of ways. First, it counted thousands of women who had abortions as not having abortions since in Denmark abortion was legalized in 1939, but the study didn't start recording women who had abortions until 1973 when the abortion records were computerized. Second, the Melbye study started counting cases of breast cancer in 1968 even though it didn't start counting abortions until 1973. They were trying to determine if abortion caused breast cancer but were including cases of women who had breast cancer 5 years before they recognized abortions as occurring. It is also noteworthy that in the Melbye study the average age of women procuring an abortion was over the age of 25 while in the United States the average age of women getting abortions at the time of the study was closer to 20.
Women should be told
Even if pro-abortion groups can't accept that abortion takes the life of an innocent human being they should at least warn women of the possible risks relating to breast cancer that having an abortion can cause.

When stroke strikes, the capillaries in the brain will gradually burst. When a stroke occurs, stay calm. No matter where the victim is, do not move him/her. Because, if moved, the capillaries will burst.
Help the victim to sit up where he is to prevent him from falling over. Again, and then the bloodletting can begin. If you have in your home an injection syringe, that would be the best, otherwise, a sewing needle or a straight pin will do. Place the needle/pin over fire to sterilize it, and then use it to prick the tip of all 10 fingers. There are no specific acupuncture points, just prick about a mm from the fingernail. Prick till blood comes out. If blood does not start to drip, then squeeze with your fingers. When all 10 digits is bleeding, wait a few minutes then the victim
will regain consciousness.
If the victim's mouth is crooked, then pull on his ears until they are red. Then prick each ear lobe twice until two drops of blood comes from each ear lobe.
After a few minutes the victim should regain consciousness. Wait till the victim regain his normal state without any abnormal symptoms then take him to the hospital, otherwise, if he was taken in the ambulance in a hurry to the hospital, the bumpy trip will cause all the capillaries in his brain to burst.
If he could save his life, barely managing to walk, then it is by the grace of his ancestors.
I learned about letting blood to save life from Chinese traditional doctor Ha Bu-Ting who lives in Sun-Juke. Furthermore, I had practical experience with it. Therefore I can say this method is 100% effective.
In 1979, I was teaching in Fung-Gaap College in Tai-Chung. One afternoon I was teaching class when another teacher came running to my classroom and said in panting, ""Mr. Liu, come quick, our supervisor has had a stroke!"" I immediately went to the 3rd floor. When I saw our supervisor, Mr. Chen Fu-Tien, his color was off, his speech was slurred, and his mouth was crooked - all the symptoms of a stroke.
I immediately asked one of the practicum students to go to the pharmacy outside the school to buy a syringe, which I used to prick Mr. Chen's 10 finger tips. When all 10 fingers were bleeding (each with a pea-sized drop of blood), after a few minutes, Mr. Chen's face regained its color and his eyes' spirit returned, too.
But his mouth was still crooked. So I pulled on his ears to fill them with blood. When his ears became red, I pricked his right earlobe twice to let out 2 drops of blood. When both earlobes had two drops of blood each, a miracle happened. Within 3-5 minutes the shape of his mouth returned to normal and his speech became clear.
We let him rest for a while and have a cup of hot tea, then we helped him go down the stairs, drove him to Wei-Wah Hospital. He rested one night and was released the next day to return to school to teach. Everything worked normally. There were no ill after-effects.
On the other hand, the usual stroke victim usually suffers irreparable bursting of the brain capillaries on the way to the hospital. As a result, these victims never recover. Therefore stroke is the no. 2 cause of death. The lucky ones will stay alive but remain paralyzed for life.
It is such a horrible thing to happen in one's life. If we can all remember this bloodletting method and start the life-saving process immediately, in a short time, the victim will be revived and regain 100% normality.

Gardasil Vaccine: One More Girl Dead
Health Impact News Editor Comments
The sudden death of a 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin, just hours after receiving the HPV Gardasil vaccine has shocked the girl's family, and sent local media out asking questions as to how this could happen. Here is a report from WISN 12 News.
Dr. Geoffrey Swain of the local health department was interviewed to give the standard CDC reply, which is similar to almost every other vaccine, stating that severe reactions like this resulting in death are ""very rare,"" and about ""1 out of a million"".
Assuming that there is some data to back up the claim of only ""1 out of a million,"" how many doses of the HPV vaccine are administered every year? According to the latest statistics (July 2014) published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services here (page 7), over 9 million per year. So the government admits that at least 9 girls per year are killed by the HPV vaccine. How many parents know this prior to taking a doctor's advice to administer this vaccine that is supposedly a protection against cervical cancer caused by the human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted disease?
Apparently, when the news broke that 12-year-old Meredith Prohaska died after receiving the HPV vaccine, at least one other parent contacted a local news station in the area to report she also had a serious adverse reaction to the HPV vaccine with her 17-year-old daughter, who needed urgent care at a local hospital. The local news affiliate asked the question: ""So what are the odds another local girl had a similar reaction after getting the shot?""
Here is the report:
These local news media, possibly covering the HPV vaccine for the first time, were all quick to interview and provide links to the official CDC view of the vaccine. But here are some other facts regarding the vaccine that they failed to disclose, probably because they did not take the time to look outside of the standard government response to events like this, or their station managers did not allow them to give any other news outside of what the CDC claims.
1. There are many more reported side effects than just death from the HPV vaccine.
They include:
Premature menopause or infertility
See:
* Human papilloma virus vaccine and primary ovarian failure: another facet of the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. July 2013, American Journal of Reproductive Immunology
* Dr. Deirdre Little, a pediatrician in Australia, was the first one to sound the alarm over the HPV vaccine causing premature menopause when she observed it in one of her 16 year old patients in 2012.
* Two sisters from Wisconsin say a cervical cancer vaccine shut down their ovaries and almost certainly left them unable to get pregnant
2. Countries Outside the U.S. Are Halting HPV Vaccines: Lawsuits due to Damages are Mounting
See:
* Gardasil Vaccine: Spain Joins Growing List of Countries to File Criminal Complaints
* Supreme Court in India to Rule on Merck Fraud Regarding HPV Vaccine Deaths
* French Medical Professionals ask: Are HPV vaccines necessary?
* Merck's Former Doctor Predicts that Gardasil will Become the Greatest Medical Scandal of All Time
* Japan Halts HPV Vaccine and Begins Full-Scale Probe over Safety Issues
* 10 More Young Women File Criminal Complaints due to Injuries from Gardasil Vaccine in France
* HPV Vaccine: Israel Health Ministry Considers Canceling Vaccination Due to Side Effects
3. You Cannot Sue the Manufacturer of Vaccines in the U.S. - They have total legal immunity
Most of the U.S. public is unaware that a U.S. citizen, by law, cannot sue a pharmaceutical company for damages resulting from vaccines. Congress gave them total legal immunity in 1986, and that law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. There is a special ""vaccine court"" called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that is funded through a tax on vaccines. If you are injured or killed by a vaccine, you must hire an attorney and fight tax-funded government attorneys to seek damages, as you cannot sue the drug manufacturers. It can take 10 years or longer to win your case and be compensated. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services usually publishes a report every couple months on settlements on their website. Here is the latest one.
4. The U.S. Government Earns Royalties from the sale of the Gardasil HPV Vaccine.
Dr. Eric Suba tried to use the Freedom of Information Act to find out how much money the National Institute of Health (NIH) earned from the sale of Gardasil, but they refused to report the amount of revenue the government earns from this vaccine (although not denying they do earn royalties). Did you know that the government earns royalties from the sale of the Gardasil vaccine? Does your doctor promoting the HPV vaccine know this?
 5. Julie Gerberding was in charge of the CDC the years the FDA approved Gardasil as a vaccine and is now the president of Merck's Vaccine division, a $5 billion dollar a year operation
Julie Gerberding was in charge of the CDC from 2002 to 2009, which includes the years the FDA approved Gardasil as a vaccine. Soon after she took over the CDC, she reportedly completely overhauled the agency's organizational structure, and many of the CDC's senior scientists and leaders either left or announced plans to leave. Some have claimed that almost all of the replacements Julie Gerberding appointed had ties to the vaccine industry.
Gerberding resigned from the CDC on January 20, 2009, and is now the president of Merck's Vaccine division, a 5 billion dollar a year operation, and the supplier of the largest number of vaccines the CDC recommends (article here).
6. Black Women who are Vaccinated with Gardasil are Vaccinated Against the Wrong Strains
Scientists at the Duke University School of Medicine discovered that African American women carry HPV strains not found in the Gardasil vaccine. Study here. Moshella Roberts, a 20-year-old African American woman died needlessly from the HPV vaccine.
Do your own research!
While it is encouraging to see local news affiliates report deaths and injuries due to the Gardasil vaccine, they need to do more research to present all of the facts, rather than just parroting what the CDC says. Of course to raise the issue of the ""Gardasil controversy"" could jeopardize your journalistic career, and force you into apologizing for suggesting the vaccine is anything but totally safe. Just ask Katie Couric.

55,﻿tron-01832,Beware of potential pollution from certain candles,"[Collected on the Internet, 2000]
(WebMD) - When Cathy Flanders, 41, of Plano, Texas, started burning candles for their pleasant smell in the spring of 1997, it never occurred to her she could be poisoning her family.
Three years, a serious illness and a lawsuit later, Flanders has a lesson to share with anyone buying scented candles: Watch out for metal wicks.
Lead emitted by this type of candle is a serious health hazard.
""Candles are fast becoming one of the most common unrecognized causes of poor indoor air quality,"" says Diane Walsh Astry, executive director of the Health House Project, an American Lung Association education project in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The Flanders' woes started when Cathy was shopping at a clothing store and spotted some candles whose labels promised to fill her house with the pleasant fragrances of ""winter"" and ""spring."" Within six months of burning the candles, she noticed soot damage around her house. But Cathy didn't pinpoint the source of the problem until after Ron Bailey of Bailey Engineering in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, analyzed the Flanders' candles and discovered lead emissions.
Around that time, 11-year-old Andrew Flanders' grades dropped precipitously. His teacher wondered if he had attention deficit disorder. When blood tests revealed an elevated level of lead, the Flanders promptly sent him to live with his aunt. ""The lead deposits in our home are such that we could not sell the house if we wanted to,"" says Flanders. As for the candles, the doctor ordered a total ban. Testing revealed the lead level in the Flanders' home to be 40 milligrams per square foot - 27 times the limit allowed in Housing and Urban Development homes.
Aromatherapy
The Flanders aren't the only ones falling victim to pleasant-smelling candles with toxic wicks. Candle sales in general have skyrocketed in recent years, according to the National Candle Association in Washington D.C., from $500 million in 1995 to $2.3 billion in 1999. Part of the candle craze may be due to new interest in aroma therapy, a type of alternative medicine in which odors are used for relaxation or to treat illness. Ironically, the very candles sometimes used for aromatherapy can cause serious health problems. The chief culprits are candles with wicks made with metal cores. ""Some candle makers use metal-core wicks because cotton wicks are often limp and fall over into the wax, extinguishing the flame,"" explains Jerome O. Nriagu, Ph.D., a professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who has studied scented candles.

Lead poisoning can lead to behavior changes and damage internal organs, especially the kidneys. Cathy's husband, Kip, had his gall bladder removed because of an illness he blames on the candles.
Metal wicks
Nriagu measured the lead released from 14 brands of candles. He found that burning four metal-wick candles for two hours can result in airborne lead concentrations that pose a threat to human health. People with weak immune systems, including children and the elderly, are particularly at risk. ""Besides breathing lead fumes, children can be exposed to even more lead that is deposited on the floor, furniture and walls because they often put their hands in their mouths,"" says Nriagu. After similar research in Australia, lead wicks in candles were banned there in September 1999. But despite the urging of experts like Nriagu, the candles are still legal in the United States. Not all candles - or even all scented candles - cause hazardous pollution. But since labels won't tell which ones are safe, Astry and other candle experts offer this advice:
Watch out for shiny metal wire inside the wicks of candles. Opt for pure paper or cotton instead.
Keep wicks trimmed to one-quarter inch for more complete combustion, and keep candles out of drafts. Windiness blows more toxins into the air and causes inefficient burning.
Watch out for slow-burning candles with additives. (These candles often feel greasy to the touch.) Instead, look for pure beeswax candles, which emit less pollution.
For aromatherapy, put a few drops of scented oil in a defuser - a tray made to fit on a lightbulb. Or you can put the drops into some boiling water.
Don't use candles in jars when the candle leaves a soot ring on the jar's lip. The soot may be an indication of lead dust.
Andrew Flanders, now 14, has moved back home. And the family is still hopeful their lawsuit will win compensation from the store that sold them the candles.

""The lead deposits in our home are such that we could not sell the house if we wanted to,"" says Flanders.
Testing revealed the lead level in the Flanders' home to be 40 milligrams per square foot - 27 times the limit allowed in Housing and Urban Development homes.
The Flanders aren't the only ones falling victim to pleasant-smelling candles with toxic wicks.
Ironically, the very candles sometimes used for aromatherapy can cause serious health problems.
The chief culprits are candles with wicks made with metal cores.
""Some candle makers use metal-core wicks because cotton wicks are often limp and fall over into the wax, extinguishing the flame,"" explains Jerome O.
Nriagu measured the lead released from 14 brands of candles.
He found that burning four metal-wick candles for two hours can result in airborne lead concentrations that pose a threat to human health.

56,﻿tron-01842,Four-year old girl intoxicated from hand sanitizer,"More children getting drunk on hand sanitizer
AtlantaCNN — 
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell swallowed three or four squirts of seemingly innocuous liquid hand sanitizer at school. It tasted good, she said, like strawberry.
It also contained enough alcohol to make her dangerously drunk. She arrived at the emergency room slurring her words and unable to walk.
Is hand sanitizer toxic?
Since 2010, poison control center hotlines across the United States have seen a nearly 400% increase in calls related to children younger than 12 ingesting hand sanitizer, according to new analysis by the Georgia Poison Center.

Common household poisons

“Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there’s a percentage of them going to the emergency room,” said Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the center’s director.
The amount of alcohol in hand sanitizer ranges from 45% to 95%. Ingesting even small amounts – as little as two or three squirts in some cases – can cause alcohol poisoning. By comparison, wine and beer contain about 12% and 5% alcohol, Lopez said.
Hand sanitizer doesn’t help in schools
Nhaijah’s blood-alcohol level was .179, twice what’s considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, who treated her in the emergency room at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta. Doctors had to watch Nhaijah overnight at a nearby children’s hospital for signs of brain trauma, since the alcohol had caused her to fall and hit her head, he said.
“That was very scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, said. “It could have been very lethal for my child.”
Alcohol poisoning can cause confusion, vomiting and drowsiness. In severe cases, a child can stop breathing.
Lopez said 3,266 hand sanitizer cases related to young children were reported to poison control centers in 2010. In 2014, the number increased to 16,117 cases.
Last week, Lopez sent a letter to Georgia’s school systems warning about children drinking hand sanitizer. He explained that some children do it intentionally in order to get drunk, while others do it on a dare from friends. Still others, he said, drink sanitizer because it looks tasty.
“A kid is not thinking this is bad for them,” Lopez said. “A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented. There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.”
Lopez recommends parents and teachers store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and monitor its use. He said nonalcohol based products or sanitizing wipes can also be used.",Narrative with Details </s> Highlighting Uncertainty and Risk </s> Using Anecdotes and Personal Experience as Evidence </s> Narrative with details_details not verified </s> emotional appeals </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> fear </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified,true,"Four-year old girl intoxicated from hand sanitizer </s> More children getting drunk on hand sanitizer

WASHINGTON - McDonald's will soon begin buying beef from overseas, citing a shortage of the U.S. meat that's lean enough to make burgers, The Associated Press reports.

In doing so, the fast-food chain joins Burger King, Wendy's and others. McDonald's is currently testing the imported beef in about 400 of its 13,000 U.S. restaurants, all in the Southeast, according to the AP.

McDonald's is the biggest single buyer of both U.S. and Australian beef, which the chain uses extensively outside of the United States. Lean beef from Australia and New Zealand sells for 5 cents to 20 cents per pound cheaper than U.S. product, according to the AP.

The National Cattlemen's Beef Association has said it will oppose any attempt by Congress or the Bush administration to allow Australia and New Zealand to increase their U.S. exports, the AP reports. Instead, American producers are trying to persuade the fast-food industry to make its burgers from more expensive but leaner parts of the cow.

""We're more than willing to work with the quick-serve restaurant chains to come up with solutions to their supply needs that involve a domestic product,"" said Kendal Frazier, a spokesman for the producers' group.

In the United States, the lean beef that the fast-food chains need for their burgers usually comes from female cattle that are slaughtered for ground beef when they are too old for breeding or producing milk. Ranchers have been cutting back on their cow herds for several years, so now there isn't enough of the animals to meet the burger industry's demands.",Establishing Legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified,true,"U.S. burger chains buying foreign beef? </s> McDonald's to Begin Importing Beef

Students from Kisii University, Kenya and the general public at large have been warned against kissing carelessly due to an outbreak of Human papilloma virus, which has seen several people admitted at Kisii level 5 hospital after testing positive to the disease.
HPV is an infectious viral disease which cause mouth cancer and is transmitted through infected body fluids and that's why people have been warned against kissing any how they want.
The symptoms include sore throat, severe headache, High fever, Vomit and abdominal pains.

Ever since the government began its quest to ""normalize"" homosexuality and other perverse sexual behavior, conservatives have been saying it's a slippery slope. After what happened at an academic conference at the University of Cambridge, it's safe to say they were right.
The ""Classifying Sex: Debating DSM-5"" conference featured speakers who condoned pedophilia as ""natural and normal for males.""
A proposal was being discussed which would essentially normalize hebephilia, the sexual preference for children in early puberty, typically 11 to 14-year-olds. The argument was made that since children are reaching puberty earlier than ever before, sex with 11 to 14-year-olds should not be considered wrong.
That this was even a topic of discussion among the worlds leading psychiatrists is incredibly alarming, but the conference took matters one step further by claiming that ""at least a sizable minority of normal males would like to have sex with children, and normal males are aroused by children.""
Ultimately, the proposal to include hebephilia as a legitimate disorder in the new edition of the American Psychiatric Association manual was defeated, and sex offenders are thrilled.
Tom O'Carroll, who is a multiple child sex offender, longtime campaigner for the legalization of sex with children and former head of the Paedophile Information Exchange, wrote about how ""wonderful"" both the conference and resulting proposal defeat were on his blog.

68,﻿snes-01852,"Johns Hopkins Scientist Exposes Flu Vaccine Danger?
Original","Johns Hopkins Scientist Reveals Shocking Report on Flu Vaccines by SYLVIA BOOTH HUBBARD
OCT 17 • VACCINES • 35197 VIEWS • 401 COMMENTS
A Johns Hopkins scientist has issued a blistering report on influenza vaccines in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). Peter Doshi, Ph.D., charges that although the vaccines are being pushed on the public in unprecedented numbers, they are less effective and cause more side effects than alleged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Further, says Doshi, the studies that underlie the CDC's policy of encouraging most people to get a yearly flu shot are often low quality studies that do not substantiate the official claims.
 
Promoting influenza vaccines is one of the most visible and aggressive public health policies in the United States, says Doshi of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Drug companies and public officials press for widespread vaccination each fall, offering vaccinations in drugstores and supermarkets. The results have been phenomenal. Only 20 years ago, 32 million doses of influenza vaccine were available in the United States on an annual basis. Today, the total has skyrocketed to 135 million doses.
 
""The vaccine may be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza seems to be overstated,"" Doshi says. Mandatory vaccination polices have been enacted, often in healthcare facilities, forcing some people to take the vaccine under threat of losing their jobs.
 
The main assertion of the CDC that fuels the push for flu vaccines each year is that influenza comes with a risk of serious complications which can cause death, especially in senior citizens and those suffering from chronic illnesses. That's not the case, said Doshi.
 
When read carefully, the CDC acknowledges that studies finding any perceived reduction in death rates may be due to the ""healthy-user effect"" - the tendency for healthier people to be vaccinated more than less-healthy people. The only randomized trial of influenza vaccine in older people found no decrease in deaths. ""This means that influenza vaccines are approved for use in older people despite any clinical trials demonstrating a reduction in serious outcomes,"" says Doshi.
 
Even when the vaccine is closely matched to the type of influenza that's prevalent, which doesn't happen every year, randomized, controlled trials of healthy adults found that vaccinating between 33 and 100 people resulted in one less case of influenza. In addition, says Doshi, no evidence exists to show that this reduction in the risk of influenza for a specific population - here in the United States, among healthy adults, for example - extrapolates into any reduced risk of serious complications from influenza, such as hospitalizations or deaths, among seniors.
 
""For most people, and possibly most doctors, officials need only claim that vaccines save lives, and it is assumed there must be solid research behind it,"" says Doshi. Unfortunately, that's not the case, he says.

Although the CDC  implies that flu vaccines are safe and there's no need to weigh benefits against risk, Doshi disagrees. He points to an Australian study that found one in every 110 children under the age of five had convulsions following vaccinations in 2009 for H1N1 influenza. Additional investigations found that the H1N1 vaccine was also associated with a spike in cases of narcolepsy among adolescents.
 
Doshi's concerns echo those of Dr. Russell Blaylock, a neurosurgeon and author of ""The Blaylock Wellness Report"" who has deep concerns over the safety and efficacy of the flu vaccine.


Not only is the vaccine not safe, Dr. Blaylock tells Newsmax Health, it doesn't even work. ""The vaccine is completely worthless, and the government knows it,"" he says. ""There are three reasons the government tells the elderly why they should get flu shots: secondary pneumonia, hospitalization, and death. Yet a study by the Cochrane group studied hundreds of thousands of people and found it offered zero protection for those three things in the general community. It offered people in nursing homes some immunity against the flu - at best one-third - but that was only if they picked the right vaccine.""
A study released in February found that the flu shot was only 9 percent effective in protecting seniors against the 2012-2013 season's most virulent influenza bug.
What's even worse is that small children who are given the flu vaccine get no protection from the disease. ""The government also says that every baby over the age of six months should have a vaccine, and they know it contains a dose of mercury that is toxic to the brain,"" says Dr. Blaylock. ""They also know the studies have shown that the flu vaccine has zero - zero - effectiveness in children under five.""
 
For most people, says Dr. Blaylock, flu vaccines don't prevent the flu but actually increase the odds of getting it. The mercury contained in vaccines is such a strong immune depressant that a flu shot suppresses immunity for several weeks. ""This makes people highly susceptible to catching the flu,"" he says. ""They may even think the vaccine gave them the flu, but that's not true - it depressed their immune system and then they caught the flu.""

Mercury overstimulates the brain for several years, says Dr. Blaylock, and that activation is the cause of Alzheimer's and other degenerative diseases. One study found that those who get the flu vaccine for three to five years increase their risk of Alzheimer's disease 10-fold.
Doshi asserts that influenza is a case of ""disease mongering"" in an effort to expand markets. He points to the fact that deaths from flu declined sharply during the middle of the 20th century, long before the huge vaccine campaigns that kicked off the 21st century.
 
Why do drug companies push the flu vaccine? ""It's all about money,"" says Dr. Blaylock. ""Vaccines are a pharmaceutical company's dream. They have a product that both the government and the media will help them sell, and since vaccines are protected, they can't be sued if anyone has a complication.""
 
Doshi's article ""is a breath of fresh air,"" says Dr. Blaylock. ""This article exposes in well-defined and articulate terms what has been known for a long time - the flu vaccine promotion is a fraud.
 
""Here's the bottom line,"" says Dr. Blaylock. ""The vast number of people who get the flu vaccine aren't going to get any benefit, but they get all of the risks and complications.""",surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> politicizing health issues </s> Highlighting Uncertainty and Risk </s> claims without evidence </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> title of article </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> distrusting government or pharmaceutical companies </s> inappropriate use of scientific evidence </s> Exploiting Science’s Limitations </s> emotional appeals </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> financial motivation </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context </s> inappropriate analogy or false connection,false,"Johns Hopkins Scientist Exposes Flu Vaccine Danger?

<i> Watch out for those spoiled onions...<i>
I had the wonderful privilege of touring Mullins Food Products. Mullins is HUGE and is owned by 11 brothers and sisters in the Mullins family. My friend Jeanne is the CEO.
The facility is mammoth. We toured about 280,000 square feet! Questions about food poisoning came up and I wanted to share what I learned from a chemist.
The guy who gave us our tour is named Ed. He's one of the brothers. Ed is a chemistry expert and is involved in developing most of the sauce formula. He's even developed sauce formula for McDonald's.
Keep in mind that Ed is a food chemistry whiz. During the tour, someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise. People are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil. Ed's answer will surprise you. Ed said that all commercially-made Mayo is completely safe. ""It doesn't even have to be refrigerated. No harm in refrigerating it, but it's not really necessary."" He explained that the pH in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment. He then talked about the quint essential picnic, with the bowl of potato salad sitting on the table and how everyone blames the mayonnaise when someone gets sick.
Ed says that when food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the 'victim' last ate ONIONS and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?). Ed says it's not the mayonnaise (as long as it's not homemade Mayo) that spoils in the outdoors. It's probably the onions, and if not the onions, it's the POTATOES. He explained, onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions. You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion. He says it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator. It's already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!)
Ed says if you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you'll probably be okay, but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich, you're asking for trouble. Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down.
So, how's that for news? Take it for what you will. I (the author) am going to be very careful about my onions from now on. For some reason, I see a lot of credibility coming from a chemist and a company, that produces millions of pounds of mayonnaise every year.'

CANCER UPDATE FROM JOHN HOPKINS HOSPITAL, US - PLEASE READ
1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have multiplied to a few billion. When doctors tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable size.
2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person's lifetime.
3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumors.
4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors.
5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.
6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.
7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.
8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction.
9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.
10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.
11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.
CANCER CELLS FEED ON:
a. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc are made with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would be Manuka honey or molasses but only in very small amounts. Table salt has a chemical added to make it white in color. Better alternative is Bragg's aminos or sea salt.
b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened soya milk cancer cells are being starved.
c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and it is best to eat fish, and a little chicken rather than beef or pork. Meat also contains livestock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites, which are all harmful, especially to people with cancer.
d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline environment. About 20% can be from cooked food including beans. Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including bean sprouts) and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).
e. Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which have high caffeine. Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties. Water-best to drink purified water, or filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap water. Distilled water is acidic, avoid it.
12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become putrefied and leads to more toxic buildup.
13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.
14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence, Essiac, anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.
15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger, unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.
16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells.",lack of citation for evidence </s> surface credibility markers - words associated with nature or healthiness </s> uppercase words </s> Inappropriate Use of Scientific and Other Evidence - out of context_verified </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context,false,"Cancer Update from Johns Hopkins </s> 1.

ABC: Experts say flu shot potentially caused the flu epidemic (Shocker, in mainstream no less)
By Erin Elizabeth -
 
(Note from Erin: Just a heads up- this is not a CDC doctor quoted below. Far too many people have looked up the fake news Snopes article, which was written well before this nurse was even quoted. <b>That has nothing to do with this story. <b> This is someone from the health department. The comments below reflect that people are NOT reading the story.
We talked at length with the editor who interviewed the health department official that gave the quote. They confirmed she did make the surprising statement. You can see it's reflected in their headline as well, which raised eyebrows. They too received much feedback about this controversial headline, which many PhDs in science and MDs have said they fully support - minus the part about receiving the vaccination regardless of the inefficacy. Thank you in advance. Founder, Erin Elizabeth)
 
According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), this year's flu is rampant in 49 states, with Wisconsin and Minnesota being hit especially hard. And one nurse thinks she knows why.

""I believe that the low effective rate of the vaccine this year is due to the mutations that the virus made in the processing of the vaccine itself,"" said Anna Treague, nurse for Public Health. ""That is at LEAST part of the reason that influenza cases are so widespread this year."" 2

As doctors continue to give the dangerous shot and the virus mutates, more people will get sick and the epidemic will worsen. It's like a bad sci-fi movie.

According to Treague, at both the beginning and end of a person's life, the immune system isn't strong, so the body has to work harder to fight off viruses. And that's why even though the shot is only 10% effective this year, at best, it's still worth your time getting.

76,﻿snes-02752,"Slime, a do-it-yourself gooey craft project containing borax, white glue, and shaving cream, comes with serious health risks.","BEWARE OF HOMEMADE SLIME
I'm writing this to let you know our experience with homemade slime. I am not a doctor or a scientist or a chemist. I just don't want what happened to my daughter to happen to anyone else.
If you have elementary age kids, you are probably familiar with the current slime obsession. My daughter and her friends became obsessed with it a few months ago and couldn't get enough of it. So much so that they decided they would start making it themselves at home, a simple endeavor providing you have the right ingredients.
Basically, homemade slime consists of:
Borax
White Glue
Water
Shaving Cream
Food Coloring (optional)
You might have also heard how stores can't even keep enough glue in stock. True story... we had a horrible time finding Elmer's Glue at our local Walmart, Hobby Lobby and Target.
There are variations of the above for sure, but these ingredients are what my daughter and her friends were using to create their slime.
We are a pretty healthy family. We get our flu shots each year and my kids have never had strep or flu or bronchial illnesses. They have never had more than your basic cold that lasted a few days. When my 12 year old got sick, we thought it was the same basic cold. Symptoms were the same: cough, sore throat, stuffy nose. She was also complaining about headaches and general achiness. Assuming her symptoms would be relieved in a few days, we didn't pay them much mind. Unfortunately, they didn't go away. At all. Weeks later, we were still left wondering what on earth was going on. To the doctor we went. We had her take a throat culture, check her lungs, and ears and sinuses. She found nothing. Other than your basic cold symptoms, there wasn't anything wrong with her on the surface.
You know how as a parent you just kind of the get the feeling that there is more to something than meets the eye? My husband was actually the one who connected the dots. He told me one night, ""Do you think it could have something to do with the slime she's been making?""
It was like a lightbulb went off. It kind of made sense all of a sudden. From that moment, we banned her from making, holding, touching or even looking at that darn slime.
The very next day, her headache went away. Her throat didn't hurt anymore. She still had some congestion, but wasn't coughing. Two days later, the congestion started going away. She was breathing better and talking better. No more achiness.
What the what??? Could the homemade slime have been poisoning my daughter?
Then this article started to make it around on some of my friends' Facebook feeds: Schoolyard Slime Craze Risk to Children Says Experts.
So I started to investigate a little more about what on earth my child was getting into. What I found out was disturbing.
BORAX - FROM THE WEBSITE, CQ CONCEPTS:
Boric acid, sodium borate, and sodium perborate are estimated to have a fatal dose from 0.1 to 0.5g/kg. These substances are toxic to all cells, and have a slow excretion rate through the kidneys. Kidney toxicity is the greatest, with liver fatty degeneration, cerebral edema, and gastroenteritis. Boric acid solutions used as an eye wash or on abraded skin are known to be especially toxic to infants, especially after repeated use due to its slow elimination rate.
GLUE - FROM THE WEBSITE, MEDILINE PLUS:
Symptoms of breathing in (""sniffing"") glue fumes may include:
* Anxiety
* Convulsions (from breathing in large amounts)
* Drunk, dazed, or dizzy appearance
* Excitability
* Headache
* Irritability
* Loss of appetite
* Nausea
* Red, runny nose
* Low oxygen level in the blood and organs (respiratory failure)
* Stupor
* Seizures
* Coma
SHAVING CREAM - FROM THE WEBSITE, HOW STUFF WORKS:
Propolene glycol is a humectant like glycerin, but unlike glycerin, it's more frequently found in antifreeze and brake fluid. Triethanolamine, better known as TEA, is an emulsifying agent, meaning it helps keep the oil and water from separating. It's also a very controversial ingredient in the cosmetic industry because not only is it a skin irritant, but many formulas containing TEA are found to be contaminated with nitrosamines, which are linked to cancer. Sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulphate (SLES) are two more controversial skincare ingredients. These make a great lather, but they also have a number of health implications. Lauryl mimics estrogen, which is especially problematic for women, and laureth often hosts a known carcinogen called dioxane.
<b> Scary stuff. <b>
Toxic. Respiratory Failure. Seizures. Cancer. Coma.
No thank you! Can I ever be 100% sure that the homemade slime ingredients were causing my daughter's illness? Probably not. But... one thing I've learned in 17 years of parenting is never to ignore your gut instinct... and ours said that making slime was hurting our kid.
All I can say is please be informed. What seemed so innocent turned out to be full of ingredients that are deadly. So even though these ingredients might have really had nothing to do with Lauryn being sick, the fact remains that these ingredients are dangerous and have no business being in the hands of children.

78,﻿snes-01085,The FDA has ruled that homeopathic drugs are now illegal,"All Homeopathic Products Now Illegal?
January 30, 2018
By Dr. Mercola
About 5 million U.S. adults and 1 million U.S. children use homeopathy every year, and the remedies are known to be ""generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions,"" according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.1 Yet, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues on its latest crusade, this natural health modality may soon be much harder to come by.
In a draft guidance document released in December 2017, the FDA takes aim at homeopathic remedies, or as they put it, ""drug products labeled as homeopathic.""2,3 In a reversal of a long-standing decision to treat homeopathic remedies differently from other drugs, the FDA has now labeled virtually all of these products as ""new drugs"" that are ""subject to FDA enforcement action at any time.""
FDA Declares Homeopathic Drugs Illegal, Plans to Ramp Up Enforcement Actions
While deaths from drugs like opioids are now a public health crisis, homeopathy has maintained a much lower, and presumably safer, profile. Yet, the FDA is using its limited resources to target the latter, citing a need to ""protect consumers who choose to use homeopathic products."" Why now? The FDA also cited a ""large uptick in products labeled as homeopathic that are being marketed for a wide array of diseases and conditions,"" to the extent that homeopathic products are now a close to $3 billion industry.4
Perhaps that's $3 billion too much for Big Pharma, FDA's cozy partner in crime. ""[I]n one fell swoop, the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally,"" the Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH USA) wrote5 - and it's not an exaggeration. In essence, the FDA's guidance reads:6
1. Any homeopathic drug that has not been considered ""generally recognized as safe and effective"" (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug
2. FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E
3. A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDA's approval process
4. No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process
The FDA then states that it's proposing a ""new, risk-based enforcement approach"" and first plans to target the ""unapproved drug products labeled as homeopathic that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients."" This includes:7
Products with reported safety concernsProducts that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concernsProducts for routes of administration other than oral and topicalProducts intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditionsProducts for vulnerable populationsProducts that do not meet standards of quality, strength or purity as required under the lawFDA Does About-Face, 'Penalizes an Entire Industry'
The draft guidance is a complete turnaround from the FDA's prior stance on homeopathic remedies, which stated, under the 1988 Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400, Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed, they did not need to get FDA approval prior to coming on the market. Instead, the ingredients in homeopathic remedies were to be verified by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS). As noted by law firm Venable:8
""Essentially, the HPUS creates a monograph for homeopathic drugs to follow, not dissimilar to the OTC drug monographs that FDA has developed for allopathic drugs. Accordingly, by virtue of an ingredient's inclusion in the HPUS, the ingredient has already been closely examined and determined to be safe and effective by the HPCUS [Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States].
Compliance with the HPUS functions as a premarket review of safety and effectiveness in the homeopathic context. By classifying homeopathic drugs as unapproved new drugs, the FDA is requiring a second showing of safety and effectiveness, a step that is unnecessary, not to mention impractical, given that the Agency intends to hold homeopathic products to an allopathic standard that is inappropriate, given the nature of homeopathic products.""
Further, it was by the FDA's own deliberate decision that homeopathic drugs were excluded from former drug approval processes and intended to be a separate category. Venable continued:9
""The FDA deliberately excluded homeopathic drugs from both the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) review (the process by which all drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 were retrospectively evaluated by the FDA for effectiveness) and the OTC Drug Review in 1972 (the process used to develop OTC drug monographs for allopathic drugs), deciding instead in the latter case to regulate homeopathic products separately because of their uniqueness.
By withdrawing the CPG and classifying all homeopathic drugs as unapproved drugs subject to FDA drug approval, the FDA is now requiring higher regulatory thresholds for OTC homeopathic drugs than are applicable to allopathic OTC drugs, many of which are permitted to be sold pursuant to the FDA monograph system. This move in effect penalizes an entire industry for the Agency's 1972 decision.""
FTC Targeted Homeopathy in 2016
The FDA isn't the first government agency to target this centuries' old natural medicine system. In a notice filed in November 2016, the FTC stated that in order for homeopathic remedies to claim they are effective, their makers must provide proof. If no proof is provided, the remedies must state there is ""no scientific evidence that the product works.""
In order to not mislead consumers, the FTC further stated that homeopathic remedies lacking sufficient proof must communicate to consumers that ""the product's claims are based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most modern medical experts.""10 Dana Ullman, MPH, CCH, one of the leading advocates for homeopathy in the U.S., said at the time:11
""Considering the longtime safety history of homeopathic medicines, it is surprising and even shocking that the FTC would consider proposing new regulations now.
One cannot help but wonder who or what is pulling their strings ... policies ... commonly result from powerful economic forces at play ... it is clear that this governmental agency is ignoring important scientific evidence, and one must wonder if they are protecting Big Pharma from competition more than protecting the consumer.""
Does Homeopathy Work?
Based on the theory that ""like cures like,"" or the Law of Similars, homeopathy was founded by German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann. The idea is that health conditions can be healed by treating a person with minute doses of a substance that would produce similar symptoms to their health condition if given in larger doses.
Homeopathy's other guiding principle is that of the minimum dose, which is based on the premise that the more a substance is diluted, the more potent homeopathic remedy it becomes, known as the ""law of infinitesimals."" Homeopathic remedies may be made from plants, minerals or other substances and are commonly administered in pellet form, dissolved under the tongue. A number of intriguing studies suggest homeopathy is effective and safe for a variety of ailments, including flu. According to Ullman:
""The use of a homeopathic medicine called Oscillococcinum is an example of a remedy that can be effective for many people with the flu, though clinical experience suggests that it is most effective when used within 48 hours of getting flu symptoms. Although most homeopathic medicines are made from the plant or mineral kingdom, Oscillococcinum is unusual in that it is made from the heart and liver of a duck.""
In one study, nearly twice as many patients who were given Oscillococcinum recovered from the flu within 48 hours as those given a placebo.12 Further, Ullman noted:
""A different group of researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind study involving 372 patients (188 treated with Oscillococcinum and 187 with placebo) of both sexes, ranging in age from 12 to 60, who presented rectal temperature ≥ 100.4 F, muscle pains, headache, or at least one of the following symptoms: shivering, chest pain, spine pain, coughing, irritation of nasal mucosa or feeling of malaise.13
Patients received three tubes of Oscillococcinum or placebo each day (morning, noon and night) for three days. The results of this trial show a highly statistically significant difference between the two groups, for what concerns disappearance of symptoms after 48 hours (19.2 percent in the Oscillococcinum group versus 17.1 percent in the placebo group) and improvement in symptoms (43.7 percent versus 38.6 percent for placebo).""
Additional research shows homeopathy's promising role in the following conditions:
In patients with allergies, those using homeopathy reported improvements in nasal airflow compared with a placebo group.
With homeopathic treatment, the researchers described a ""clear, significant and clinically relevant improvement in nasal inspiratory peak flow, similar to that found with topical steroids.""14Homeopathy significantly reduced the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis (swelling and sores in the mouth) in children.15Homeopathic medicine was effective in treating acute childhood diarrhea, decreasing both the duration of the diarrhea and the number of stools per day.16,17Homeopathy has positive effects in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly in the areas of behavioral and cognitive functions.18Homeopathy lessened tender point pain and improved quality of life in people with fibromyalgia.19Homeopathic was effective in treating the early stages of vitiligo in a report of 14 cases20FDA Continues to Crack Down on Natural Substances, Protect Big Pharma
The FDA's new push to regulate homeopathic products is eerily reminiscent of their recent crackdown on the plant kratom. Leaves from the kratom tree have been used for pain relief for hundreds of years, but scientists now know they contain compounds that target the brain similarly to opioids, helping to relieve pain. It appears the plant may be safer than opioids for pain relief and could even act as a tool to help those suffering from opioid withdrawal.
In November 2017, however, rather than targeting the prescription opioids that are the root of the opioid epidemic, the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding risks associated with kratom use, suggesting that its usage could ""expand the opioid epidemic."" What this comes down to, for some, is the right to choose what form of ""medicine"" to put in your body. As Dr. Lee Hieb, an orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, wrote in WND:21
""I'm not here to tout any particular over-the-counter remedy, but who gave the FDA total ability to limit what we can take into our bodies, while virtually forcing us to be given what they prescribe? It's none of their business whether a 'homeopathic remedy' is worthless.
That's an issue of commerce and truth in advertising. I, for one, want the freedom to research and decide for myself what supplements to take, even if my supplements ultimately do me no good. (Many do a great deal of good as Big Pharma knows only too well.)""
People have the right to choose their treatment, and doctors (many of whom admit to prescribing placebos to their patients) also retain the right to offer treatments they deem useful, whether it be homeopathy or another remedy.
As for the FDA's new draft guidance on homeopathic drugs, it's attempting to discredit such remedies' proven healing powers before their mechanisms of action have even been fully understood.

By classifying homeopathic drugs as unapproved new drugs, the FDA is requiring a second showing of safety and effectiveness, a step that is unnecessary, not to mention impractical, given that the Agency intends to hold homeopathic products to an allopathic standard that is inappropriate, given the nature of homeopathic products.""
In November 2017, however, rather than targeting the prescription opioids that are the root of the opioid epidemic, the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding risks associated with kratom use, suggesting that its usage could ""expand the opioid epidemic."" What this comes down to, for some, is the right to choose what form of ""medicine"" to put in your body.
As for the FDA's new draft guidance on homeopathic drugs, it's attempting to discredit such remedies' proven healing powers before their mechanisms of action have even been fully understood.",,

FDA Investigates Safety Of Chicken Jerky Treats Made In China
DENVER (CBS4) Dog owners across the country are making the connection between chicken jerky treats that are made in China and serious illnesses in their dogs. The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, has gotten hundreds of complaints about the popular treats and has issued warnings, but so far there has been no recall.
Candace Thaxton of Westlake, Ohio blames chicken jerky treats made in China for the death of her dog, Chansey, a 10-year-old pug. Chansey went into kidney failure. When she got a new mixed breed puppy, Penny, and the puppy started having kidney problems, Thaxton made the connection. Chicken jerky treats made in China were the only thing the two dogs had in common.
""I was sitting at the computer and I saw the warning on the chicken jerky treats,"" Thaxton said.
The  FDA, has issued 3 warnings regarding chicken jerky treats made in China. In November 2011, the FDA warning stated that the agency saw an increase in the number of complaints it's received of dog illnesses, and the signs of illness included kidney problems.
""I went and grabbed the bag and when I looked at the bag, it said it was manufactured and distributed in South Carolina, but under the bar code it had 'Made In China',"" Thaxton remembered.
It was a bag of Waggin' Train Chicken Jerky Treats. Thaxton was able to get Penny to the vet in time and she has since recovered, but the medical bills for both dogs total thousands of dollars. Thaxton contacted Nestle Purina, the makers of the treats.
""She told me that there were a thousand reasons why my pug could have died,"" Thaxton said.

Since then, Thaxton has been on a crusade to publicize the problem and hold the FDA and the treat makers accountable. She told her story to local television stations and called Senator Sherrod Brown, her representative in Ohio. Brown has since taken up the cause in Congress.
It was the television appearance that help Terry Safranek make the connection.
""Oh my gosh, that's exactly when and where my dog started getting sick,"" Safranek said.
The Brooklyn Heights, Ohio resident had a 9-year-old fox terrier named Sampson. Sampson also died from kidney failure.
""He was lethargic, he seemed sad, he seemed depressed, and he was drinking and urinating a lot,"" Safranek recalled.
Dog owners who are making the connection between chicken jerky treats made in China and illness in their dogs report these symptoms:
-- Decreased appetite
-- Decreased activity
-- Vomiting
-- Diarrhea - sometimes with blood
-- Increased water consumption
-- Increased urination
-- Kidney problems, including Fanconi-like syndrome
""I'm devastated because, I know, it came from my hand. I fed him the treat that killed him,"" Safranek said.
The FDA issued its first warning about the treats in 2007, another warning was issued in 2008, and then again in 2011 after the FDA saw the number of complaints rise. The agency reports doing extensive testing of the treats and finding nothing in them that would cause illness. In its latest update in March of 2012, the FDA states, ""no specific products have been recalled because a definitive cause has not been determined"". The FDA confirms that there are investigators in China inspecting the manufacturing plants and trying to find the cause of the problem.

The makers of these products all say the safety of pets is their highest priority and there is no link between the illnesses and their treats.
""We have an extensive quality assurance process in place. We have looked at this and we continue to look at this, said Keith Schopp, a spokesperson for Nestle Purina.
Because there is no recall, these treats are still on store shelves. CBS4 found chicken jerky treats made in China for sale at Petco, PetSmart, and Walmart. Whole Foods and Costco carry treats made in the U.S.A. Petco, PetSmart and Walmart all say they are aware of the situation and are monitoring it. Each of the retailers sites the lack of a direct connection between the treats and the illnesses as the reason they haven't stopped selling the treats.
Despite the lack of a recall, many veterinarians are warning dog owners away from the chicken jerky treats made in China.
""If you have a bag in your cupboard?"" asked 4 On Your Side Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks.
""Throw it out,"" replied Dr. Shannon Jordan a veterinarian with Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital.
Jordan says she's treated one case that may have been related to chicken jerky treats made in China, but she can't be sure. CBS4 checked with about a dozen other local animal hospitals and clinics, most have not had any cases and several said they hadn't heard about the FDA warning. Dr. Jordan warns dog owners that kidney problems are nothing to play around with.
""It's progressive, typically. So you may start off with simple signs of not eating and vomiting, and it may progress to the point where we can't... those kidneys can't repair themselves,"" Jordan told CBS4.
There is an alternative to chicken jerky treats made in China. There are chicken jerky treats made in the U.S.A. In fact, there is a plant in Denver that makes chicken jerky treats. Kasel Industries makes Nature's Deli which is sold by major retailers like Costco, Target, Petco, and Sam's Club.
""We use fresh, human grade ingredients, fresh, human grade products. Everything we buy we bring in fresh from the slaughter houses or processing plants,"" said Raymond Kasel, president of Kasel Industries.
Nature's Deli offers a wide variety of dog treats all processed in the U.S.A. Kasel says his plants are inspected not only by the FDA but also by the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
""We are always scored as a human, food grade plant even though it's for pets, it's no difference,"" Kasel told CBS4.
Bold American flags stand out on Nature's Deli packaging. Most dog treats made in the U.S.A. are making their labels more prominent. Pet owners should know that if the label says ""Manufactured for"" or ""Distributed by"" an American company the product could still be made in China. You need to check the entire bag carefully to find the ""Made in China"" label.
""I fed my dogs poison,"" Thaxton said.
Knowledge came too late for Candace Thaxton and Terry Safranek. Now they are both working hard to make sure that other pet owners are educated on this issue.
""We don't want another dog to die from chicken jerky,"" Safranek said.
Safranek started an online petition urging Nestle Purina to pull it's treats made in China. So far the petition has gotten more than 60,000 signatures. She's also joined a facebook group called ""Animal Parents Against Pet Treats Made in China!"". The group has some 4,000 members and created a flyer to get the message out.

BREAKING: San Diego Declares EMERGENCY… 15 DEAD, 400 HOSPITALIZED
SEPTEMBER 3, 2017
BY DEAN JAMES
Dean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS–
The ultra liberal city of San Diego, California which incidentally is inundated with illegal aliens is facing a health crisis and authorities have declared PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.
A public health emergency was declared Friday over an outbreak of ‘hepatitis A’ that has been linked to at least 15 deaths and 400 hospitalizations.
The liver disease outbreak started last November, with the homeless population affected most. The emergency declaration will help the city access state funds and provide legal protection for new sanitation measures, the Union-Tribune reported.
Areas with high concentrations of homeless people will receive roughly 40 portable hand-washing stations to help combat the disease, which can spread through fecal matter when people fail to thoroughly clean their hands after using the restroom.
Crews also plan to use bleach-spiked water for high-pressure washing to remove “all feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces,” according to a sanitation plan outlined in a letter Thursday.
Other cities in the region can expect to see similar hand-washing and street-sanitizing efforts, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region’s public health officer, FOX News reported.
After previous vaccination and educational programs failed to significantly reduce the infection rate, and with death reports spiking in recent weeks, San Diego decided to mimic a campaign used in Los Angeles, which is home to tens of thousands of homeless, in an attempt to curb the outbreak.
“We know that L.A. has had no local cases of hepatitis A related to the strain that we’re seeing here in San Diego,” Wooten said. “If they’re doing it there and they haven’t had any cases, it could be beneficial here as well.”
The moves in San Diego follow finger-pointing between city and county officials, with both sides insisting they were doing the best they could under tough circumstances, the newspaper said.
“There is no precedent for this,” Wooten said. “We will definitely have a playbook for if we have something like this in the future. But this is the first time we have had something of this nature happen.”

These kind of problems are typical in liberal cities.

82,﻿snes-02161,Cancer is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B17 a condition that can be remedied with nutritional supplements.,"A SECRET HAS BEEN UNCOVERED: CANCER IS NOT A DISEASE BUT BUSINESS!
The word called cancer is a lie...
You might not believe this but cancer is not a disease; it is a business.
Cancer has become widespread; it has affected the old, young, baby and everyone.
Sharing this wonderful post will expose many of the hidden hands of the world's manipulators and annoy them.
Do you know that the book ""World Without Cancer"" has up till now been prevented from being translated into many world languages?
Know this: there is no disease called cancer. Cancer consists of only a deficiency of vitamin B17. It is nothing else.
Avoid chemotherapy, surgery and or taking medicines with strong side effects.
You would recall that in the past, quite a large number of seamen lost their life to a named disease (scurvy); a disease that took the life of numerous people as well. And a number of people got an enormous income from it. Afterwards, it was discovered that scurvy was just a deficiency of vitamin C. That means it wasn't a disease (illness).
Cancer is also just like that! The colonizing world and the enemies of humanity established the cancer industry and made it into a business. from which they earn billions in income.
The cancer industry flourished after world war II. To fight cancer, all these delays, details and enormous expenditures are not needed. They only go to line the pockets of colonizers, especially since the cure for the condition was found long ago.
The prevention and cure of cancer will be obtained simply through the following strategies:
Those who have cancer should first try to know what cancer is. Do not panic! You should investigate the condition.
Nowadays does anyone die of an illness called scurvy? No. Because it gets cured.
Since cancer is only a deficiency of vitamin B17, eating 15 to 20 pieces of apricot stone/nucleus (fruit stone) everyday is enough.
Eat wheat bud (wheat sprouts). Wheat bud is a miraculous anti-cancer medicine. It is a rich source of liquid oxygen and the strongest anti-cancer matter named laetrile. This matter is present in the fruit stone of apple and is the extracted form of vitamin B17 (Amygdalin).
The American medicinal industry has started implementing the law forbidding laetrile production. This medicine is being manufactured in Mexico and gets smuggled into USA.
Dr. Harold W. Manner, in a book named ""Death of Cancer"" has stated that the success of cancer treatment with laetrile is as high as above 90%.
Sources of Amygdalin (Vitamin B17)
The foods containing vitamin B17 include the following:
-The fruit stone or grain(seed) of fruits. This contains the highest amount of vitamin B17 in nature. This includes fruit stone of apple, apricot, peach, pear, and prune (dried plum).
-Common beans, corns(grains), which include bean, lentil sprout (lentil bud) Lima (Lima beans) and pea.
-Kernels: Bitter Almond (Richest source of vitamin B-17 in nature) and Indian almond.
-Mulberries: almost all mulberries such as black mulberry, blueberry, raspberry and strawberry.
-Seeds (Grains): sesame and linseed (seed of linen/flax seed).
-Groats of oats, barley, brown rice, groats of block wheat, linseed, millet and rye.
This vitamin is found in grains and fruit stones of apricot, brewer's yeast, rough rice (paddy) and sweetmeat pumpkin.
List of Anti-Cancer Foods
•Apricots (kernels/seeds)
•seeds from other fruits like apples, cherries, peaches, prunes, plums, pears
•Lima beans
•Fava beans
•Wheatgrass
•Almonds
•Raspberries
•Elderberries
•Strawberries
•Blackberries
•Blueberries
•Buckwheat
•Sorghum
•Barley
•Millet
•Cashews
•Macadamia nuts
•Bean sprouts
All are the highest sources of absorbable vitamin B17.
Ingesting dishwashing liquids (used in the kitchen) and hand washing liquid (used in the restroom) bis the main cancer causing factor so your eating of them should be restricted.
You will surely say that we do not eat them!
However, you daily wash your hands with hand washing liquid and wash your plates with dishwashing liquid.
The liquid is absorbed and will not leave the plate with washing. When cooking or eating food, the soap in the plate or dish gets attached to the hot food and so we end up eating the dishwashing liquid with our food. Even if you rinse the plate hundreds of times, that will be of no use.
But the solution is to pour half of the dishwashing liquid and hand washing liquid and top it up with vinegar.
It is as simple as that.
Do not eat blood cancer causing agents and also save your family from this danger.
Similarly, seriously desist from washing vegetables with even a few drops of dishwashing liquid because irrespective of how much you would rinse them, the chemicals would have already entered the tissues of the vegetable and will not get rinsed away.
Instead, soak fruits and vegetables with salt and then rinse with water. And to keep them fresh, add vinegar.
Please share this post with others so they can also benefit from the information.

You might not believe this but cancer is not a disease; it is a business.
Do you know that the book ""World Without Cancer"" has up till now been prevented from being translated into many world languages?
Know this: there is no disease called cancer.
Cancer consists of only a deficiency of vitamin B17.
The colonizing world and the enemies of humanity established the cancer industry and made it into a business.
The cancer industry flourished after world war II.
The prevention and cure of cancer will be obtained simply through the following strategies:
Since cancer is only a deficiency of vitamin B17, eating 15 to 20 pieces of apricot stone/nucleus (fruit stone) everyday is enough.
Wheat bud is a miraculous anti-cancer medicine.
It is a rich source of liquid oxygen and the strongest anti-cancer matter named laetrile.
This matter is present in the fruit stone of apple and is the extracted form of vitamin B17 (Amygdalin).
Sources of Amygdalin (Vitamin B17)
The foods containing vitamin B17 include the following:
This contains the highest amount of vitamin B17 in nature.
This includes fruit stone of apple, apricot, peach, pear, and prune (dried plum).
-Kernels: Bitter Almond (Richest source of vitamin B-17 in nature) and Indian almond.
This vitamin is found in grains and fruit stones of apricot, brewer's yeast, rough rice (paddy) and sweetmeat pumpkin.
List of Anti-Cancer Foods
All are the highest sources of absorbable vitamin B17.
Ingesting dishwashing liquids (used in the kitchen) and hand washing liquid (used in the restroom) bis the main cancer causing factor so your eating of them should be restricted.
But the solution is to pour half of the dishwashing liquid and hand washing liquid and top it up with vinegar.

83,﻿snes-04356,Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein has stated that she opposes the use of vaccines.,"Jill Stein’s Ideas Are Terrible. She Is Not the Savior the Left Is Looking For.

Now that Hillary Clinton has officially won the Democratic presidential nomination, chances are we’re going to hear a lot more about Jill Stein. The Green Party candidate, currently polling in the low single digits nationally, has been gunning for the support of disaffected Bernie Sanders fans, urging them to “keep the revolution going” by getting behind her own long-shot White House bid. Tuesday, she was on hand at the Democratic convention to meet aggrieved Sanders delegates, some of whom formed a small crowd around her to chant, “Bernie or Jill.” Thanks to progressive grassroots rage, she may well peel off a few percentage points of the vote come the fall, when she’s expected to be on the ballot in about 47 states.
Which is a pity. Because even by the standards of protest candidates, Stein—whose press team did not respond to an interview request—is an absolutely awful torchbearer for the far left. She’s a Harvard-trained physician who panders to pseudoscience. She mangles pet policy issues. And her cynical retelling of the past eight years has nothing to do with the reality of recorded history.
Let’s begin with Stein’s platform. Some of the ideas, like a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition, are mainstream these days, thanks to the work of progressive activists and Sanders himself. Others, like moving to 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 (while ditching nuclear), are deeply unrealistic, if admirable in spirit. And more than a few sound like they were hatched in an old Bay Area commune. Cut defense spending in half and close more than 700 foreign military bases? Sure, maybe after we get done levitating the Pentagon.
Tucked into this long, starry-eyed list of progressive causes are a few lines that remind you of the far left’s fraught relationship with biological science. There’s a call not just to label genetically modified foods but to “put a moratorium on GMOs and pesticides until they are proven safe.” Never mind that scientists have studied GMOs extensively and found no signs of danger to human health—Stein would like medical researchers to prove a negative. She would also “Ban neonicotinoids and other pesticides that threaten the survival of bees, butterflies, and other pollinators.” This is a nod to the discredited theory that some pesticides are driving the collapse of honeybee populations (which, by the way, are not actually collapsing). Again, this is somewhat standard stuff on the far left these days, but coming from a physician, it’s discouraging. It is also in keeping with the last official Green Party platform, from 2014, which supports the “teaching, funding, and practice” of “alternative therapies” such as naturopathy and homeopathy, i.e. funneling money into quack medicine. (Stein first ran for president as a green in 2012).
Worse, though, was Stein’s response during a Reddit AMA when she was asked about her party’s stance on vaccines. Her answer was a 380-word evasion in which she allowed that childhood immunizations had “made a huge contribution to the public health” while simultaneously suggesting that Americans have good reason to be wary of the drug approval process and that there’s “a lot of snake-oil in this system.” She wrote:
In most countries, people trust their regulatory agencies and have very high rates of vaccination through voluntary programs. In the US, however, regulatory agencies are routinely packed with corporate lobbyists and CEOs. So the foxes are guarding the chicken coop as usual in the US. So who wouldn’t be skeptical?
Despite clearly understanding that vaccines are safe, Stein is pandering to her audience by telling them their worries are justified and offering fuel for those fears by painting a dark picture of a corrupt regulatory apparatus. For comparison, consider Bernie Sanders’ answer on the same life or death issue, as reported by as reported by the Daily Beast:
“I think obviously vaccinations work. Vaccination has worked for many, many years.” He went on to note, “I am sensitive to the fact that there are some families who disagree but the difficulty is if I have a kid who is suffering from an illness who is subjected to a kid who walks into a room without vaccines that could kill that child and that’s wrong.”
That’s a straightforward answer about vaccines. Risking the health of other people’s children to satisfy your own minority concerns about medical science is wrong.
Mercifully, dying pollinators, GMOs, and vaccines aren’t at the core of Stein’s campaign. But she doesn’t fare much better on other issues. During a June interview with Cenk Uygur, Stein explained her strategy for wooing voters more or less boiled down to promising them she would forgive their student loans. “There are 43 million young people, and going into middle age and beyond, who are trapped in predatory student loan debt,” she said. “They happen to be very well-networked. They’re really good at self-organizing on the internet. There’s only one place that they can put their votes in order to cancel their debt.” (The section starts at 17:34 in the video below.)
[Video: Dr. Jill Stein Interview With The Young Turks' Cenk Uygur]
This, it should be noted, is not a very progressive idea, despite its popularity among the collegiate left. A disproportionate amount of student debt is held by comfortably paid professionals who went to private colleges or graduate school. Forgiving their loans in a mass jubilee would not be the greatest use of limited resources if you’re interested in fighting inequality. But forget all that for the moment.
Instead, focus on the specifics of Stein’s plan, which are based on a shockingly poor understanding of recent economic history. “My campaign is the only one that will do for young people what our misleaders saw fit to do for Wall Street not that long ago,” she told Uygur, echoing one of Elizabeth Warren’s more misleading arguments. Then, she got into the utterly misguided details. Student loans, Stein explained, “should be canceled in the same way that the debt of Wall Street was canceled, essentially writing it off as a digital ‘hat trick,’ which is done in the form of quantitative easing.”
Wait, write off student loans through quantitative easing? What? Is that really what she’s saying? Yes, that is what she’s saying. Here is Stein describing her understanding of the Wall Street bailout and explaining how it relates to her student loan plan:
[The bailout involved] about $17 trillion if you include the free loans. And the free loans largely got paid back. … Forget about the free loans and just consider the debt that was canceled. That was $4 trillion in the form of quantitative easing. So that’s not money that was transferred to them. It’s simply a debt that was bought up by the U.S. government, and then essentially zeroed out, canceled. So it didn’t put money in their pockets so to speak. But it rid them of all that debt that they would otherwise have to pay. So that’s exactly what we are calling for here, a quantitative easing which is not money in their pocket. It’s essentially that the government has bought up that loan and it tears up the contract. It’s over.
This is wrong. Flat wrong. Quantitative easing was an unconventional monetary policy tool the Federal Reserve used to try and revive the economy after the financial crisis once it had emptied its normal bag of tricks. There have been vigorous debates about whether it was wise, or whether it worked. But it did not involve buying and canceling debt owed by the banks. Quite the opposite—it involved buying and holding onto debts owned by the banks (or other investors, for that matter), such as Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
This might sound like a small distinction if you’re not a monetary policy obsessive. But it’s absolutely essential to understanding what the Fed was doing, and the rationale behind it. (Among other things, holding onto the debts, rather than canceling them, was a key part of how the Fed planned to contain inflation down the line.) Stein’s description is so far off, it’s as if someone asked her how to play basketball, and she answered that teams scored points by kicking the ball off the backboard.
It’s possible Stein is being purposely misleading. The main point of quantitative easing was to drive down interest rates throughout the financial markets, making it cheaper for companies to borrow and invest, or for homeowners to take out mortgages. However, some people have argued that the first round of QE, the one that took place in 2009, was in fact a secret bailout, because it involved buying mass quantities of mortgage-backed securities from banks. These were the toxic assets at the heart of the financial crisis that collapsed in value as Americans defaulted on their home loans. While there may be a grain of truth in this theory, the problem with it is that the Fed was buying mortgage bonds backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were far less toxic than bonds that weren’t backed by the housing agencies. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s stated explanation, that the central bank was trying to make it easier and cheaper to get a mortgage by reviving the market for mortgage-backed securities, makes plenty of sense on its own.
If Stein is trying to simplify the “secret bailout” story so she can say the government is going to do for students what the Fed did for the banks, then she’s lying about the details of a conspiracy theory. But Occam’s razor suggests Stein probably just has no idea what she’s talking about. That’s likewise disturbing, given that this is the single policy proposal she thinks is going to win her 43 million voters, the amount she claims she’ll need to win the presidency. Beyond that, Stein wants to move the various Federal Reserve banks into the Treasury Department, ending their independence while also putting an end to fractional reserve banking, which underpins our whole monetary system. I’m sure she has all the details of those grand plans straight, too.
Finally, I would be remiss not to note the plainly self-interested way in which Stein elides the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties. This is, of course, standard third-party politicking. But in Stein’s case, it’s especially egregious. Her 2015 response to the State of the Union is replete with comments about how Barack Obama “led the charge for austerity” and “made the Bush tax cuts permanent.” Obama did, of course, team with John Boehner to push for a grand bargain to raise taxes and cut entitlements—a push that failed, by the way. He also made some, though not all, of Bush’s cuts permanent. But he did so in the face of a radicalized Republican opposition that has repeatedly threatened not to raise the debt ceiling (which, according to Stein’s On the Issues page, she also opposed raising, preferring a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts—the definition of austerity) and at one point followed through on its threat to shut down the government. To ignore that is to blind yourself to eight years of political history.
I could go on. This doesn’t even touch the sort of mundane conspiracies Stein likes to weave into her rhetoric, such as the Trumpian claim that the government’s “unemployment figures … are designed to essentially cover up unemployment.” The bottom line is that Jill Stein is not a figure anybody should trust. She’s not just an uncompromising progressive. She’s a panderer who raves about subjects about which she appears to lack the vaguest understanding. She is right about one thing: There is a lot of snake oil in the system. And she’s selling it.","lack of citation for evidence </s> ingroup vs. outgroup </s> rhetorical tricks </s> politicizing health issues </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> lack of evidence or use unverified and incomplete evidence to make a claim </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence",false,"Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein has stated that she opposes the use of vaccines. </s> Tuesday, she was on hand at the Democratic convention to meet aggrieved Sanders delegates, some of whom formed a small crowd around her to chant, “Bernie or Jill.” Thanks to progressive grassroots rage, she may well peel off a few percentage points of the vote come the fall, when she’s expected to be on the ballot in about 47 states.

To make a long story short she ended up having to send the steak back 4 times because each time it came back bloody.
By the time she had to send it back all those times she was not really hungry, ate a few bites and asked for a doggy bag to take the rest home.
Well, she got sick that night.
So sick her husband took her to the Emergency Room at Carle.
There she had to have her stomach pumped.
The doctors asked her where she had eaten, what she had eaten.
After telling the doctor, the doctor asked if by chance they brought some home.
The husband said yes and went home to get it so they could take tests on it in their lab.
After taking the steak to the lab .
it came back positive with human urine on it!
The lady has to have tests every 3-6 months now for disease for the next 6 years!
The husband said he would own the restaurant or will put them out of business.
They have a big lawsuit going I guess.
They are doing DNA on the steak to find out who urinated on it.
the restaurant was The Outback in CHAMPAIGN!
Isn't that just GROSS!
I would be so mad and a lawsuit would not be my stopping point either!

Original","Monsanto Is Scrambling To Bury This Breaking Story - Don't Let This Go Unshared!
I am frankly shocked this information is not making front page news right now. Monsanto will do anything to bury this story... and as of right now, it's working. Not a single mainstream media outlet has covered this appalling new report that shows millions of people being poisoned by a chemical that does not belong in our food. This chemical is ending up in processed foods like Cheerios, Ritz Crackers, and Oreos and being consumed by humans across the world. The health of millions of people is on the line and this news must go mainstream! That's why I'm calling on every single one of you who reads this post to <b>share this breaking story now. <b> The only way this injustice will be corrected is if enough of us stand up and demand that something be done to stop the poisoning of our food supply.
<b>Share this shocking new report with everyone you know....<b>
<b>A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto's Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts. <b>
[image of glyphosate food testing results] 
{See the test results and full report by Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project}.
Here is why we all should be concerned about eating glyphosate:
* Independent research links glyphosate to cancer (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and it has been deemed a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization's team of international cancer experts. The childhood cancer rate is steadily rising and experts say that they don't know why. Why are they not taking a closer look at these facts?
* Research also indicates that glyphosate is an endocrine disruptor, which disrupts hormones and leads to reproductive problems, early onset puberty, obesity, diabetes, and some cancers. When it comes to endocrine disruptors, very small exposures are the most damaging, so ""the dose makes the poison"" mantra does not apply! 
* Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic killing the good bacteria in your gut. Poor gut health is linked to inflammation and a whole host of diseases. As GMOs laced with glyphosate are commonly fed to farm animals, this could very well be contributing to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
* It binds with vital nutrients in the soil (like iron, calcium, manganese, zinc) and prevents plants for taking them up. Glyphosate is thereby making food less nutritious!
Why is this weed killer in these foods? Even non-GMO and organic food! 
This chemical has gone so mainstream that glyphosate has infiltrated every facet of our environment - our water, air, soil.
* Many GMOs were invented to be resistant to glyphosate - and since GMOs have been introduced the use of glyphosate has gone through the roof! It is now the world's most widely used herbicide.
* Glyphosate is not just used on GMOs. Conventional (non-organic farmers) use Roundup as a drying agent on crops, such as oats and wheat. It can't be simply washed off, as it is taken up into the plant itself.
* As the active ingredient in popular ""Roundup"" herbicide, millions of people are using this stuff around their homes, and it's widely used at parks and other public spaces.
So, that is why it's not just GMO-filled junk food that is laced with glyphosate. It's contaminating organic and non-GMO foods, and it's even in our honey! The FDA quietly found it in almost every single sample of honey that they tested (from mass produced to organic mountain honey). The media has been essentially silent and barely anyone heard this news!
Even if you don't personally eat the specific brands that were tested (I don't), how many people are eating Cheerios and Ritz Crackers every day? A lot!
How many of your friends and family have their cabinets filled with these foods? These people need to know this information.
There are still thousands of other brands and whole foods that have not been tested for glyphosate residues, so we can't be so sure that our own organic, non-GMO, and unprocessed food is safe. Americans are effectively being forced to eat this poison until something is done to stop the rampant use of this chemical. Yes, I said poison.
Monsanto doesn't want the public to know these findings for obvious reasons. They have our regulatory agencies in their back pocket to make sure they can continue to make a hefty profit while poisoning the masses.
While there are now several manufacturers of glyphosate herbicides, Monsanto completely dominates the market and this is a best seller. They are raking in BILLIONS every year and certainly don't want that to stop. They are clearly, without a doubt, using their prosperity to influence our government regulators. Why else would those entrusted to protect the public from harmful chemicals turn a blind eye to this?
Our public agencies are allowing corporations to poison Americans for profit.
In 2013, the EPA massively increased the industry standard of what is considered a ""safe"" level of glyphosate on our food, in order to make enormous amounts seem A-OK. Instead of properly regulating, they effectively raised the ""safe"" level so that no one can blame the industry for poisoning us with unlawful amounts of chemicals. This is corruption at its finest. The EPA has a long and sordid history of doing whatever Monsanto wants and you have to ask yourself why this continues to happen and how we can make it stop.
The EPA continues to pander to Monsanto, as they keep postponing and dragging their feet to evaluate glyphosate's link to cancer in humans. The industry is fighting tooth and nail to make sure that the EPA ""evaluation"" will be in their favor and is trying to control who will be on the panel. Why won't the EPA do their job to make sure that the world's most widely used herbicide isn't causing us all to get cancer? Don't you think this should be a top priority? It's time for the EPA to put the public health above the corrupt desires of corporations.
When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided to suspend their testing this week. Could it be that Monsanto didn't like the results they started getting - especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.
Doesn't the public deserve to know this information? It should be shouted from the rooftops! 
It is shameful that the American media has thus far failed to cover this breaking news, but WE HAVE THE POWER to make this information go viral. If you really want to stop the corruption perpetuated by Monsanto and the large chemical companies - this is how we shut them down!
<u>CALL TO ACTION:<u> Share this post with everyone you know. Tweet, share, and email this information to major media outlets and ask them to cover this story. 
Remember the best way to avoid glyphosate is by choosing certified organic foods because it is prohibited on organic crops. Although contamination is a real threat, the levels on organic foods are minimal compared to what's been found on conventional foods. It's been shown that people who eat organic foods have less glyphosate and other synthetic pesticides in their system. 
The people of this country must be informed and this should be our top priority. Go, Food Babe Army, Go!

87,﻿snes-01403,"Canada has legalized euthanasia, enabling parents to ""kill disabled children.""","Canada Legalizes Euthanasia For Parents To Kill Their Disabled Kids
November 22, 2017 Sean Adl-Tabatabai News, World 2
<b> Doctors in Canada have been given the green-light to euthanise disabled, sick or dying children under a controversial new law. <b>
The legislation extends existing 'assisted suicide' laws that have been legal in Canada over a year now, in which adults can legally volunteer to end their own life.
The new legislation passes the responsibility of consensual death for minors over to the parents.
Liftsitenews.com reports: American anti-euthanasia activist Wesley Smith said the results of the survey prove the morally slippery slope that a nation slides down when it agrees that ""killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering.""
""Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed, it never stops expanding,"" he wrote in the National Review.
""I guess Robert Latimer-a Canadian farmer who murdered his daughter because she had cerebral palsy-was a visionary,"" he added.
The CPS surveyed its members in light of the possibility Canada will expand euthanasia to children.
 

18,798
Indeed, Justin Trudeau's Liberal government wrote that possibility into the law it passed in June 2016.
Bill C-14 permits voluntary euthanasia for individuals of at least 18 years of age assessed to be suffering intolerably from a grievous and irremediable medical condition, and with natural death reasonably foreseeable.
But the Commons Justice Committee added an amendment to the bill directing the federal government to review expanding euthanasia on three further grounds: for children, or ""mature"" minors; solely for mental illness; and allowing advance directives in the case of those with degenerative diseases such as dementia.
The Liberals have asked the Council of Canadian Academics to research these questions, and report to Parliament by the end of 2018.
The CPS surveyed 1050 pediatricians on their experiences with ""medical aid in dying"" or MAID, and released a report at the end of October.
Forty-five doctors reported receiving explicit requests from parents to euthanize 91 children, it said. More than half of these requests were for ""neonates or infants under a year old.""
A further 118 pediatricians had ""exploratory"" discussions about euthanasia with parents of 419 children.
As for requests from the children themselves, 35 paediatricians reported discussing euthanasia with 60 minors. Nine reported receiving direct requests for euthanasia from 17 minors.
While ""such consultations may be rare, minors in Canada are contemplating MAID-related concepts and approaching health care providers with MAID-related questions,"" noted the CPS survey.
""Given the evolving legislative landscape, it is reasonable to anticipate that such questions will increase in the near future.""
The CPS also conducted an attitude survey on euthanasia, with 574 of a possible 1,979 members, or 29 percent, responding.
Of these, 46 percent supported euthanizing mature minors who have ""progressive or terminal illness or intractable pain.""
Thirty-three percent opposed euthanizing mature minors for any reason.
Mature minors are children who are allegedly capable of understanding the nature and consequences of treatment, and so judged competent to request death by lethal injection.
The CPS study suggested non-voluntary euthanasia for non-competent dying ""and/or severely disabled"" children is not far off.
Canada's federal law, and Quebec's law currently prohibit involuntary euthanasia for anyone, it said, adding:
<i> However, given the human rights framework advanced in Carter v. Canada, the parents of a dying and/or severely disabled child who is deemed to be suffering may, in the near future, be looking to the courts to support a right to end their child's life. Decision-making for treatment of never-competent children is based on the ""best interest standard"": choosing among options that reasonable persons, acting in good faith on another's behalf, would consider acceptable in similar circumstances. <i>
""All this is very problematic,"" says Alex Schadenberg, executive director of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition.
Euthanasia lobbyists shift the argument for legalizing the killing of children by lethal injection from the autonomy of the individual to ""why do you want to allow them to suffer,"" he told LifeSiteNews.
""So the idea is, well, this isn't fair, the law has an inequality because you're allowing adults who are capable of requesting this, but not children or mature minors.""
Parents and guardians in Canada currently can authorize no treatment or the withdrawal of treatment for non-competent minors, Schadenberg added.
""If you had a child with a significant disability, then the question at birth would be, do you want that child to receive treatment or not, and you would have the right to say yes or no,"" he said.
""So the argument is well, because we already have that, therefore, what's the difference between that"" and euthanasia.
Schadenberg echoed Smith's warning that once euthanasia is allowed, the grounds for legally killing people keep expanding, as has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions.
The Netherlands adopted the Groningen Protocol in 2004, he pointed out.
It gives doctors impunity to lethally inject disabled infants, such as those spinal bifida or hydrocephalus.
The CPS study ""shows us that the parents were the ones to ask about euthanasia. Rarely did the mature minor or child consider euthanasia,"" Schadenberg said.
""The concept of euthanasia for children should be simply rejected based on the fact that children cannot consent.""","title of article as clickbait </s> politicizing health issues </s> evidence does not support conclusion </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> political figures or political argument </s> bolded,  underline or italicized </s> emotional appeals </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified",false,"Canada has legalized euthanasia, enabling parents to ""kill disabled children."" </s> <b> Doctors in Canada have been given the green-light to euthanise disabled, sick or dying children under a controversial new law.

89,﻿tron-01429,Contaminated Lemon Slices in Restaurants,"The Serious Reason You Need to Stop Putting Lemon Wedges Into Your Water
Marissa LaliberteUpdated: Feb. 27, 2019
Guaranteed someone at your table will order one.
It's likely the first thing your server will ask when you sit down for a restaurant meal: What would you like to drink? Well, there's one incredibly popular drink that you might not want to order.
Whether you ask for it or not, a glass of water or Diet Coke usually comes with a slice of lemon. But be warned: Despite all the health benefits of lemon water, you might want to tell your server to leave the citrus out. Don't miss these other 7 foods chefs never order at restaurants.
A 2007 study in the Journal of Environmental Health tested 76 lemons from 21 restaurants for germs and had some pretty freaky findings. Nearly 70 percent of the lemon slices had bacteria, viruses, and other microbes-including disease-causing E. coli. Even though lemon is a natural germ-killer, it can still get contaminated itself.
Another ABC investigation testing one lemon at 10 different restaurants found that half the wedges contained human waste. Gross! Check out these other gross things restaurants do to save money.
Lemon wedges are way more likely to have bacteria than the food you order on a plate because restaurant health standards tend to be less strict for garnishes. The ABC investigation noticed that restaurant workers often grabbed lemons without gloves or tongs. If they didn't scrub their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or touching another germ-ridden spot, there's a good chance they could leave that bacteria on the lemon in your drink. Plus, restaurants might just rinse the skin instead of giving each fruit a good scrub.
But before you start giving servers the death glare when you see them carrying lemon water, know that the garnish won't necessarily make you sick. The 2007 study authors admitted there haven't been any diseases or outbreaks linked to lemons, and that still holds true today. And microbiology expert Philip Tierno, PhD, who led the ABC investigation, says your immune system will usually protect you from getting sick from lemon water. Before sitting down at a table, watch out for these red flags you're about to eat at a bad restaurant.
""The usual course will probably result in no infection, but there is a possibility,"" Dr. Tierno, clinical professor of microbiology and pathology at NYU Langone Medical Center, tells the Huffington Post when discussing his findings. ""You can't live in a bubble. Your immune system is usually pretty good.""
Still, if you're concerned, just request your server bring your water or soda with no lemon. And if you can't live without it, try squeezing in the juice then setting the wedge aside. Even though the juice has bacteria, at least you won't have germs from the rind floating in your glass, too. Don't skip the lemon water at home though, because drinking lemon water has incredible health benefits. Just make sure to wash it before putting it in your glass.

It's likely the first thing your server will ask when you sit down for a restaurant meal: What would you like to drink?
Well, there's one incredibly popular drink that you might not want to order.
Whether you ask for it or not, a glass of water or Diet Coke usually comes with a slice of lemon.
But be warned: Despite all the health benefits of lemon water, you might want to tell your server to leave the citrus out.
Don't miss these other 7 foods chefs never order at restaurants.
A 2007 study in the Journal of Environmental Health tested 76 lemons from 21 restaurants for germs and had some pretty freaky findings.
Another ABC investigation testing one lemon at 10 different restaurants found that half the wedges contained human waste.
Check out these other gross things restaurants do to save money.
Lemon wedges are way more likely to have bacteria than the food you order on a plate because restaurant health standards tend to be less strict for garnishes.
The ABC investigation noticed that restaurant workers often grabbed lemons without gloves or tongs.
If they didn't scrub their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or touching another germ-ridden spot, there's a good chance they could leave that bacteria on the lemon in your drink.
Plus, restaurants might just rinse the skin instead of giving each fruit a good scrub.
But before you start giving servers the death glare when you see them carrying lemon water, know that the garnish won't necessarily make you sick.

90,﻿tron-01414,A Warning that Pyrex Glass Cookware Can Explode,"About 5:30 PM there was a loud bang from the oven. Sylvia opened the oven door and the Pyrex dish had shattered into a million pieces. The roast beef (our first in many months) was peppered with small shards of very sharp glass. Normally, I am quick to inform Sylvia she did something stupid. However, this time she was nowhere near the stove when it blew. I shoveled the glass and the now mashed potatoes into a bucket with two putty knives. I then sucked the remains with the shop vac. I let everything cool down and then scrubbed the oven with Simple Green and some hot soapy water. It took over an hour to clean up the goo. Upon completion I ran the oven empty to see if the temperature controller was working okay. I suspected the oven got too hot and the dish simply blew. This was not the case however. The oven came up to temperature and cycled normally. We threw a disgusting frozen pizza in the oven and it cooked okay.
What is going on?
I Googled exploding Pyrex dishes and got ten million hits. Exploding Pyrex is very common.
Here is the story.
A long, long time ago in a country we all know and love was a company named Corning. They made Pryex dishes. The material they used is called borosilicate glass. This stuff is indestructible.
But like everything else, the Bottom Liners had a great idea: sell the technology to another company. The Chinese discovered that using soda lime glass was almost as good as borosilicate glass and a lot cheaper. Today, Wal-Mart is the largest distributor of Pryex products. Corning not only sold the technology to a company called World Kitchen, they also sold the rights to the original Pyrex logo. Seamless. The consumer will never know.
Now it seems people are getting hurt using soda lime Pyrex. We were lucky because the dish broke while the oven was closed and the damage was limited to the oven cavity. Others have been less fortunate. Some dishes explode when they are lifted from the heating rack in the oven with devastating results. Some people are heavily scarred. World Kitchen is in denial. They say that the dishes are another brand, not theirs. Contrary to their denials the victims usually have more than one of these dishes and the Pryex logo is clearly visible.
If you buy a Pryex dish beware. The label on the front says oven safe, freezer safe, microwave safe. The instructions on the back tell another story. You cannot move a soda lime Pyrex dish from the freezer to the oven and expect it to survive. The fine print does on and on about what you are not allowed to do with the Pyrex dish. The fine print has prevented World Kitchen from being sued because they have warned the consumer that their Pyrex dishes are junk from the get go. And they are the same price as the original Corning dishes. What a bunch of losers we all are for buying this crap.
What to do?
If you own borosilicate Pryex dishes no fear. They have to be more than 25 years old to be sure they are indeed Corning dishes. I am not sure if the old Pryex dishes have anything stamped in them that indicates they are made by Corning. You may continue to use the soda lime dishes for holding stuff. Just do not attempt to roast or microwave with them as the hazard is very clear.
The reason the soda lime dishes let go is that over time they develop micro-cracks. Once a few micro-cracks are present and once some liquid finds its way into the cracks you have the bomb situation. The liquid is like shoving a crowbar in the dish and pulling it apart. Super heated liquids expand rapidly and it is the super heated liquids that force the soda lime glass to shatter into tens of thousands of shards.
Since Corning no longer makes Pyrex and Sylvia proudly holds a large collection of the soda lime Pyrex, we decided that one bomb in the kitchen is enough. The Pyrex dishes will go bye-bye in this week's trash. I do not know what we will use for cake and pie dishes going forward. If you have some suggestions we are listening.
I strongly urge you not to use the soda lime Pyrex for the oven, stovetop or microwave. The slightest invisible crack is all it takes to have a mess and a possible injury.

Luckily it was before his 3-year-old daughter drank it. 

Cameron Hardwick, a father in Indiana, was getting ready to give his three-year-old daughter a treat after she finished her dinner. Luckily, though, before the Capri Sun got into the child's hands, Hardwick noticed something strange floating in the pouch. It was mold. Hardwick posted on Facebook to get the message out to other parents, urging friends and family to please read and share his message. ""I grabbed one [Capri Sun] out of the refrigerator and notice something odd about it... it seems low in content, I take a closer look at the packaging and didn't notice a hole or anything,"" the post says. Hardwick proceeded to shake up the Capri Sun, ""only to find an unknown substance floating around in the package."" EW.
""To say we are irate would be an understatement... we don't give these to our children often but will NEVER again! #SERIOUSLY #CapriSun"", Hardwick's post continuted, followed by a video of him explaining the incident, and two photos.
Kraft Heinz, the makers of Capri Sun, reached out to Hardwick. ""A third party company came to the house to pick up the 'sample' & package the following day, then sent it to the lab for testing.. they came back with the results a few days later and said there was a 'micro-puncture' in the package allowing oxygen to enter the pouch and create the mold seen in the video/pictures"" Hardwick wrote in another Facebook post.
Evidently, Capri Sun's packaging is created strategically for the very purpose of checking for mold, which is just slightly unsettling. The first question in the list of ""FAQ about what's in Our Products"" on Capri Sun's website is, ""Help! I found mold in my Capri Sun pouch. Will it make my child sick?""
""It's unpleasant, but it's unlikely to make you or child sick,"" Capri Sun explains on the site. ""Although it's rare, it is possible for food mold to grow inside containers of preservative-free juice drinks if the pouch is compromised or punctured in any way on its journey from our facilities to your grocery stores.""
""The mold is naturally-occurring, and we understand your concerns,"" Capri Sun continues. ""That's why we created our clear bottom pouches so you can check for mold before enjoying your Capri Sun."" Geez...I wonder if I've ever unknowingly gulped down a mold-ridden Capri Sun, because I definitely have never checked the bottom for mold.
Capri Sun mentions in the FAQs that they recommend parents ""gently squeeze each pouch to check for leaks before serving Capri Sun to their kids."" Also, any leaky or punctured pouches should be thrown away.

94,﻿snes-00530,President Trump is signing a law legalizing marijuana across the United States.,"Trump Set To Legalize Medical Marijuana In All 50 States
May 27, 2018 Baxter Dmitry News, US 32
<b> President Trump is set to sign legislation which will make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients. The bill, known as the ""Right to Try Act,"" will prohibit the FDA from banning natural cures, and allow patients to try medications that have not been approved by the FDA, but are currently under clinical trial. <b> 
Right to Try was passed unanimously by the Senate last summer and by the House of Representatives on Tuesday in a vote of 250 to 169, after Trump personally lobbied for its passage. While the bill's provisions are targeted at a wide range of medications, they also apply to medical marijuana thanks to a clinical trial being conducted by the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Sciences (MAPS).
Tweet embedded: Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years, RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK.
- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2018
Herb reports: The MAPS trial, currently in the second phase of the FDA approval process, is testing the effectiveness of smoked cannabis in veterans with PTSD and meets all of the criteria set out by the Right to Try. 
The majority of states already have their own form of Right to Try legislation, with one notable exception being New York. In Utah, a recently passed law specifically addresses the right of terminally ill patients to try cannabis. However, because cannabis remains federally prohibited, even if a terminally ill patient has the ""Right to Try"" cannabis on the state level, they're still in violation of federal law.
The Right to Try bill, recently passed by Congress, would change that. In addition to cannabis, MDMA and psilocybin could also potentially be used by 'eligible patients' since FDA trials of both substances meet the requirements set out in the federal bill.
What's not clear is what illnesses qualify as life-threatening. Post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, could be argued to be life-threatening given the high rates of suicide among those who are diagnosed, but it's up for debate. It's likely that those details will be hammered out on a state by state basis in jurisdictions that have already passed their own version of Right to Try. The full title of the bill suggests as much stating, ""in accordance with State law...""
However, in states that lack their own local provisions, the new bill appears to leave plenty of room for interpretation and a potential conflict with local drug laws.
Under the broad wording of the federal bill, no specific illnesses are mentioned. Instead, an 'eligible patient' is defined as, ""Diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted; and Diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes, where the endpoint of clinical trial analysis is survival.""
Patients must also have exhausted all existing treatment options and must be unable to participate in the ongoing trials investigating the drug they want access to. Additionally, they must provide written consent from a qualified physician who does not stand to gain from the trial.
The bill passed on Tuesday after receiving some opposition from Democrats on Capitol Hill who believe that the law will undermine the FDA's processes.
It's likely that President Trump will sign the bill in the coming days since he has personally lobbied Congress for its passage. In January, Trump even mentioned the bill in his State of the Union Address saying, ""People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try.""
Early Wednesday morning, Trump reiterated his support for the bill tweeting his intention to sign it into law.","politicizing health issues </s> evidence does not support conclusion </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> political figures or political argument </s> bolded,  underline or italicized </s> uppercase words </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified",false,"President Trump is signing a law legalizing marijuana across the United States. </s> Trump Set To Legalize Medical Marijuana In All 50 States

Herb reports: The MAPS trial, currently in the second phase of the FDA approval process, is testing the effectiveness of smoked cannabis in veterans with PTSD and meets all of the criteria set out by the Right to Try.
The majority of states already have their own form of Right to Try legislation, with one notable exception being New York.
In Utah, a recently passed law specifically addresses the right of terminally ill patients to try cannabis.
However, because cannabis remains federally prohibited, even if a terminally ill patient has the ""Right to Try"" cannabis on the state level, they're still in violation of federal law.
The Right to Try bill, recently passed by Congress, would change that.
In addition to cannabis, MDMA and psilocybin could also potentially be used by 'eligible patients' since FDA trials of both substances meet the requirements set out in the federal bill.
It's likely that those details will be hammered out on a state by state basis in jurisdictions that have already passed their own version of Right to Try. The full title of the bill suggests as much stating, ""in accordance with State law...""
Instead, an 'eligible patient' is defined as, ""Diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted; and Diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes, where the endpoint of clinical trial analysis is survival.""
It's likely that President Trump will sign the bill in the coming days since he has personally lobbied Congress for its passage.
In January, Trump even mentioned the bill in his State of the Union Address saying, ""People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure.

By Noah Salzberg, Online Features Editor
April 30, 2014
A new phenomenon has spread through the halls of CHS like wildfire, and this new trend is unlike many others. Simply put, it involves Burt's Bees Peppermint lip balm.
""Beezing,"" as it is called, is to spread Burt's Bees peppermint lip balm on one's eyelids to obtain a weird yet enticing sensation.
""When you beeze, it's like your eyes are eating a York peppermint patty,"" senior Dilan Hettiarachchi said. ""There is just this cool, minty sensation on your eyelids.""
With its unknown origin, Beezing is a trend not only at CHS, but also around the country, with stories of Beezing coming from the states of New Jersey and New York. Nevertheless, it is quickly spreading throughout the CHS population.
""I found out about beezing from my friends on cross country,"" junior Eric Murray said. ""I now beeze twice a week.""
The usage of the words ""beezing"" and ""stung""-a word that describes the state after which you have applied the lip balm to the eyelids- may make beezing sound unhealthy and dangerous. This, however, is completely contrary to the truth. There is no health effect; the only effect of beezing is the sensation on the eyelids.
According to a Burt's Bees representative, Burt's Bees ""does not make any claims about putting the lip balm on the eyelids.""
""There is no downside to beezing,"" Murray said. ""The only effect is the cool, minty sensation on the eyelids.""
The common perception about beezing is that the minty, burning feeling on the eyelids helps keep the person alert and focused.
""I beeze to stay awake,"" senior Nikhil Perincherry said. ""It helps me to stay alert and always be on my 'A' game.""
As with all trends, many students in the CHS community are opposed to beezing because they perceive it as unsophisticated.
""The premise of beezing is one that appears to be very dumb since it is not something that you usually see,"" junior Olivia Shannon said.
However, many opponents of the fad find no reason for people not to try beezing other than the possibility of looking strange while doing it.
""It is something people should try at least once to experience,"" Shannon said. ""It is a very interesting feeling.""
Whether or not beezing is just another fad to come and go through the halls of CHS is a mystery, but its legacy is one that will leave an impact on the students who have tried it.

The deal also includes an exchange of debt.
The purchase values Smithfield Foods at $7.1 billion - a figure that would make the purchase ""the largest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company,"" according to Bloomberg News.
In addition to Smithfield, the company's brands include Armour, Eckrich, Gwaltney, Kretschmar, and others. The company's roots stretch back to 1936, when the Luter family opened a packing plant in Virginia.
Terms of the purchase value Smithfield's stock at $34 a share - a premium of more than 30 percent over the company's closing share price yesterday. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the sale, says the company's shares rose sharply before the markets opened Wednesday.
The deal will require approval from U.S. regulators before it is final.
""This is a great transaction for all Smithfield stakeholders, as well as for American farmers and U.S. agriculture,"" Smithfield president and CEO Larry Pope said. ""We have established Smithfield as the world's leading and most trusted vertically integrated pork processor and hog producer, and are excited that Shuanghui recognizes our best-in-class operations, our outstanding food safety practices and our 46,000 hard-working and dedicated employees.""

""China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of pork and the third-largest market for U.S. pork,"" Reuters reports. ""In recent months, a series of food safety scandals have dented consumer confidence.""
Smithfield's headquarters will remain in Virginia, according to a press release announcing the deal this morning. The companies also said that Shuangui will not close any Smithfield facilities, and will leave all employee agreements - and the existing management team - in place.
The purchase would further solidify an economic relationship between China and Virginia that has been growing. The state has sent several trade missions to Asia in recent years, helping China become what Gov. Bob McDonnell calls ""far and away our largest trading partner,"" as member station WAMU recently reported.

107,﻿snes-03632,Life expectancy in the United States is now lower because of Obamacare.,"Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge
Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer
Tags: Americans, life expectancy, plummeting health
 (NaturalNews) For many years, the assumption has been that the United States leads the world as an advanced civilization, dominating in categories like education, quality of life, and life expectancy. But a new study released this year by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) paints a much different picture, suggesting that Americans are less healthy and will more than likely live much shorter lives compared to those in previous generations.

The 36-page report reveals that the average 65-year-old American man today will most likely die just short of his 86th birthday, while the average 65-year-old American woman only has about two years longer until she dies, on average, around age 88. This might not sound like anything out of the ordinary, except that these figures are actually down compared to last year's report using the same criteria.

Over the past several years, the report explains, American health has taken a major downturn. Life expectancy amongst 65-year-olds is down by about six months, on average. It's also down for younger Americans, who are likewise expected to live about six months less than in previous generations. In nearly every generational category, including ""Baby Boomers,"" ""Generation X,"" and ""Millennials,"" life expectancy is down, and will likely continue to go down.

This is especially the case among middle-aged, non-Hispanic whites, who a recent study by Princeton University found are increasingly succumbing to the detrimental effects of bad habits like alcohol and drug abuse, unhealthy diet, and lack of exercise. This report also highlights increasing rates of suicide within younger populations, a sad state of affairs that says even more about the current state of our society.

Mortality rates are still rising, the data suggests, but at an increasingly lower rate. And if things continue on the current trajectory, eventually overall life expectancy will be on the downturn - that is, unless the factors contributing to this decline are addressed and brought to bear. If they aren't, the average American life will likely continue to decline into the future.


Pension payers, insurance companies see dollar signs as people die earlier
While the study's findings have many applications in terms of social science research, the one area where they're making the biggest ripples involves employee pensions. By looking at this new life expectancy data through the lens of post-retirement disbursements, employers can determine whether or not their liabilities will increase or decrease - and based on the most current data, it appears that a decrease is on the way.

""The updated scale provides the latest information to help accurately measure pension obligations,"" says Dale Hall, managing director of research at the SOA. ""However, it is up to pension plan sponsors, working with their plan actuaries, to determine how to incorporate emerging mortality improvement data into their plan valuations.""

With the growing popularity of 401k accounts as opposed to pensions, the new data can also help employees who handle their own retirement affairs better ascertain how much they need to make, and how much they need to save, to live comfortably until their deaths. All of this information makes a difference when determining the price of annuities and insurance contracts whereby insurance companies are obligated to pay out until the time a person dies.

Year-over-year changes in mortality are very volatile,"" Hall adds, noting that something as simple as a bad flu season can disrupt the death rate averages.

At the same time, some experts claim that longevity rates in the long-term are still on an upward trajectory, and that soon-to-be retirees and younger folks alike need to take into account the fact that they could live much longer than the latest figures suggest, and to plan accordingly.",distrusting government or corporations </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> Inappropriate Use of Scientific and Other Evidence - out of context_verified </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> financial motivation </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility,false,"Life expectancy in the United States is now lower because of Obamacare. </s> Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge

Women tend to require more sleep than men because of their ""complex"" brains, according to research.
Scientists found that around 20 minutes more sleep was needed by women compared to men - and said this was thought to be because the female brain works harder during the day.
The study was carried out on a sample set of 210 middle-aged men and women.
""One of the major functions of sleep is to allow the brain to recover and repair itself,"" study author Jim Horne, a sleep expert formerly director of the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, told the Mail Online.
""During deep sleep, the cortex - the part of the brain responsible for thought memory, language and so on - disengages from the senses and goes into recovery mode.""
Prof Horn said the amount of sleep was necessitated by the complexity and intensity of brain activity during the day.
He said: ""The more of your brain you use during the day, the more of it that needs to recover and, consequently, the more sleep you need.
""Women tend to multi-task - they do lots at once and are flexible - and so they use more of their actual brain than men do. Because of that, their sleep need is greater.
""The average is 20 minutes more, but some women may need slightly more or less than this.""
However, he said men who have complex jobs which involve a lot of ""decision-making and lateral thinking"" are also likely to need more sleep than the average male.
The study also found that poor sleep among women was linked to a number of side effects.

111,﻿tron-01798,Flu Shots Cause Alzheimer's Disease,"Some Flu Shot Formulations Contain Brain-Destroying Toxin: Top Doctor
By Sylvia Booth Hubbard    |   Thursday, 20 November 2014 12:01 PM EST
Although flu shots are promoted as safe, that's not true, says holistic family physician Dr. David Brownstein. Flu shots contain several suspect ingredients, including the carcinogen formaldehyde, and many contain mercury in the form of thimerosal.
 
""Mercury is one of the most poisonous substances known to mankind,"" Dr. Brownstein tells Newsmax Health. ""It is a potent neurotoxin and is associated with a host of neurological and immune system problems. Mercury should never be injected into any living human being.""
 
A study published by the National Institutes of Health stated: ""Mercury is a highly toxic element; there is no known safe level of exposure. Ideally, neither children nor adults should have any mercury in their bodies because it provides no physiological benefit."" Yet, the FDA allows it to be put in flu shots given to pregnant women, children, and the elderly - all known to be most at risk for neurological damage, says Dr. Brownstein, editor of the newsletter Dr. David Brownstein's Natural Way to Health,
 
Thimerosal, a preservative found in many flu shots, is 50 percent mercury. It's different, and much more harmful, than the type of mercury found in fish. While the FDA warns against eating more than two servings of fish weekly because of the danger of mercury, it allows this more toxic form to be added to flu shots (and other vaccines). The only reason thimerosal is added is as a preservative in multi-dose vials.
 
Known as ethylmercury, this type of mercury in flu shots depresses the immune system and damages the brain. Much of ethylmercury is converted in the body to a form of mercury that accumulates in the brain with every annual flu shot and is very difficult to remove. Ethylmercury is much more harmful than methylmercury, the form of mercury found in fish, and is much more likely to stay in the brain. 
 
For years, thimerosal has been associated with an increase in autism, but one of the most troubling connections is with Alzheimer's. ""There's no doubt that the flu vaccine can lead to Alzheimer's, because many flu shots are preserved with mercury and it's a known brain toxin,"" says Dr. Brownstein. ""You give enough brain toxins and people are going to develop memory issues.""
 
One report by world-renowned immunogeneticist Dr. Hugh Fudenberg found that people 55 years of age and older who got a flu vaccine for five years straight increased their risk of Alzheimer's by 10 times. Another connection between flu shots and Alzheimer's was made by Dr. Boyd Haley of the University of Kentucky. He wrote: ""Seven of the characteristic markers that we look for to distinguish Alzheimer's disease can be produced in normal brain tissues, or cultures of neurons, by the addition of extremely low levels of mercury.""
 
Still, the American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends flu shots for pregnant women calling it ""essential.""
 
""The flu vaccine has not been properly studied in pregnant women,"" says Dr. Brownstein. ""In fact, in the package insert for the FluLaval quadrivalent vaccine it states, 'There are ... no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women and FluLaval quadrivalent should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.'""
 
Not only can flu shots contain harmful ingredients but many experts, including Dr. Brownstein, believe they don't prevent flu. ""Those promoting flu shots promise they'll cut your risk of getting flu by more than 50 percent, but that's simply not true. When you dissect the studies, you'll find the FluLaval vaccine is 97 percent ineffective.""
 
If you decide to take a flu shot, however, you can lessen your chances of harm by choosing a vaccine that doesn't contain mercury. Since thimerosal is used only as a preservative in multi-dose vials, avoid it by asking for a single-dose vial. Or ask for the flu nasal-spray vaccine. It doesn't contain thimerosal.
 
 
If you decide not to take the flu shot, Dr. Brownstein suggests protecting yourself with the following steps:
 
1. Eat a healthy diet. Avoid refined foods, especially sugar. ""Refined sugar has been shown to disrupt the functioning of the white blood cells responsible for fighting off viruses,"" he says.
 
2. Keep hydrated. A rule of thumb for adequate hydration is to take your weight and divide by two. The result will tell you how many ounces of water to drink every day. 
 
3. Take vitamin C. Dr. Brownstein suggests taking 3,000 to 5,000 mg every day and upping the amount to perhaps 10,000 mg if you become ill. Vitamins A and D, iodine, and alpha lipoic acid are also helpful.
 
4. Wash your hands. ""Simple hand-washing and avoiding sick people can greatly lessen your chances of getting the flu.""",lack of citation for evidence </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context </s> fear </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> surface credibility markers - words associated with nature or healthiness </s> lack of evidence or use unverified and incomplete evidence to make a claim </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> surface credibility markers - medical or scientific jargon </s> shifting hypothesis </s> emotional appeals </s> Inappropriate Use of Scientific and Other Evidence - out of context_verified </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence </s> title of article as clickbait </s> rhetorical tricks </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> Highlighting Uncertainty and Risk </s> exaggeration/absolute language,false,"Flu Shots Cause Alzheimer's Disease </s> Some Flu Shot Formulations Contain Brain-Destroying Toxin: Top Doctor

114,﻿snes-00714,"A ""new"" study has demonstrated that marijuana leads to a ""complete remission"" of Crohn's disease.	
Original","Medical Marijuana Achieves 'Complete Remission' Of Crohn's Disease; Drug Improves Appetite And Sleep Function, With No Side Effects 
By Chris Weller 
Crohn's disease, one of several inflammatory bowel diseases, achieved ""complete remission"" in nearly half the subjects of one study that were exposed to smoking medical marijuana on a regular basis.
Published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the study examined the effects of consistent marijuana use on Crohn's patients who suffered from severe cases of the disease. The results of the 21-subject study point toward the drug's anti-inflammatory properties as being responsible for quieting symptoms in many patients, and even reaching total remission in others.
The Disease: Causes, Symptoms, And Treatments
Often mischaracterized as an autoimmune disease, Crohn's disease is in fact an immune deficiency state. Arising from a host of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors, the disease causes a chronic inflammatory disorder that attacks the person's gastrointestinal tract - anywhere from the mouth to the anus - in order to fight the body's antigens that otherwise do no harm. Symptoms of the disease range from mild abdominal pain to more severe cases of bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and fevers.
There is no cure for Crohn's; however, various methods are aimed at limiting flare ups and keeping the disease in remission. Treatments, like disease severity, fall on a spectrum depending on the person. Simple dietary changes suffice for some, while invasive surgery to remove the affected area may be needed for others. Corticosteroids and other medications are also prescribed for less severe cases.
The disease affects around 400,000 to 600,000 people in North America, although many people do not get diagnosed until they've had the disease for years, simply because no symptoms were present.
The Study And Its Findings
Scientists at Meir Medical Center in Israel wanted to examine the effects of Cannabis sativa on patients with severe Crohn's disease, relying on the underlying drug's anti-inflammatory effects in treating other ailments, such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
""The marijuana plant Cannabis sativa has been reported to produce beneficial effects for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, but this has not been investigated in controlled trials,"" the researchers wrote. ""We performed a prospective trial to determine whether cannabis can induce remission in patients with Crohn's disease.""
Twenty-one people with severe, intractable Crohn's comprised the study. Out of those 21, 11 subjects smoked two joints a day for eight weeks. The other 10 made up the placebo group.
The results were particularly telling, according to the researchers. In total, five of the 11 subjects smoking marijuana daily achieved total remission of their Crohn's. They reported greater appetites and sleep patterns. (People with severe cases of Crohn's sometimes defecate 20 times per day, and may even wake up at night to do so.) Moreover, ""a clinical response"" was found in 10 of those 11. Only four of the 10 placebo subjects reported any improvements.
These findings, argued the researchers, demonstrate how ""THC-rich cannabis produced significant clinical, steroid-free benefits to 11 patients with active Crohn's disease, compared with placebo, without side effects.""
The researchers were hesitant to call the study a total success, however, saying that the ""primary end point of the study (induction of remission) was not achieved,"" despite the five of 11 people who reported those effects.
Still, they noted that their findings merit further attention. ""Further studies, with larger patient groups and a nonsmoking mode of intake, are warranted,"" they wrote, pointing to the potentially diminished effects of smoking marijuana, as opposed to extracting the anti-inflammatory drugs directly from the plant.

A British mom opened up a can of parasites when she tried to make tuna for dinner.
Zoe Butler found a tiny parasite inside a can of tuna - and scientists said it is likely a tongue-eating variety.
The Nottingham mom found the beady-eyed parasite tucked inside a can of Princes tuna chunks last month. She posted images of the alien-like creature on Twitter, hoping someone could identify her unwelcome dinner guest.
Finally, she got her answer. The parasite is probably a Cymothoa exigua, also known as the tongue-eating louse, Stuart Hine from London's Natural History Museum told the Telegraph this week.
A Cymothoa exigua enters a fish through its gills and attaches to the host's tongue. The parasites are not considered harmful to humans.
Hine hasn't inspected the parasite in person and noted that only through a thorough examination could he confirm its identity; but he said the photos suggest it is a tongue-eating louse. Other experts speculated it could be a juvenile crab or a tadpole.
A spokesman for Princes said it asked Butler to send the company the parasite so it could conduct an analysis.
Butler bought the tainted can from a Nottingham grocery store last month. She was getting ready to serve it to her kids for dinner when she noticed the canned fish had eyes, she said.
""I opened the top of the lid and saw a purply thing, a gut sack or intestine - then I turned it round and pushed it with a fork and saw it looking back at me,"" she told the Nottingham Post last month. It was dead when she found it.
She continued: ""I haven't shown it to the kids because they might get put off eating tuna.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Sunday refused to say if some women would lose access to birth control benefits after Republicans repeal President Barack Obama's health care reform law. The Wisconsin Republican promised during an interview on CNN that the repeal of Obamacare would lower the costs of health care by providing ""vouchers"" to poor Americans. CNN host Jake Tapper noted that many women were paying nothing for birth control thanks to an Affordable Care Act mandate. ""Is that going to end?"" he wondered. ""Look, I'm not going to get into all the nitty-gritty details of these things,"" Ryan replied curly.
""I'm not a preacher, nor am I a holy man, but the fact to the matter is that Obamacare is bad for our economy, it's bad for Americans, both poor ones and ones who aren't, overall, it's a bad program and a bad piece of legislation and that's why it's gotta go,"" Ryan argued stubbornly, all the while ignoring the question. ""And if our biology allowed for a safe way to have intercourse, if we were meant to have intercourse completely naturally and not get pregnant because of it, then God would have included something about it in one of his Holy Books. Now, I haven't found anything on the subject - and not for lack of looking, Jake - have you, perhaps?""
""We're going completely off topic here,"" Tapper tried to get the conversation back on track. ""Do you or do you not admit that,"" he attempted to form a sentence, when Ryan rudely interrupted him and said, ""Look Jake, I respect everything you're trying to do here, I get you're a big-shot reporter, anchor or whatever they call you people these days, it doesn't even matter. The fact to the matter is - we are in a situation here where the citizens of our country were led to believe that they actually had something to gain thanks to Obamacare. Yet, it was never explained to them that all those benefits had to come from somewhere, and the former president never told them that they came from hard-working Americans whose taxes were raised to pay for the so-called free birth control.""
""Now, how would you feel, Jake, if someone were to take a huge chunk of your hard-earned money and use it to give something to someone you've never met?"" Ryan asked the host. ""And the worst part is - nobody asked Americans whether or not they agree to their taxes being raised to help people they don't know, that very fact goes against the essence of capitalism. It's not effective and it's not efficient, which makes it the wrong solution from the start. That's why it needs to be repealed. The other part of the reason why women shouldn't be allowed to use birth control at all is the fact that, in doing so, they're committing murder and that goes against everything this country stands for.""
""You have to understand, just like millions of Americans out there have to understand: God didn't want us to be able to have unprotected sex that wouldn't result in pregnancy. That's not how we were designed and every time someone uses birth control, they're effectively going against God's wishes and committing manslaughter.

124,﻿snes-06359,- Some symptoms of a heart attack are subtle and can be mistaken for indigestion,"Is It Indigestion or Heart Attack?
July 9, 2021 | Heart & Vascular
Heartburn and heart attack pain can be similar, learn the difference

You're relaxing at home after a delicious meal. You notice you don't feel quite right. You have an upset stomach. There is a burning sensation in your chest area.

Is it heartburn from indigestion? Could it be a heart attack?

Chest discomfort is the most common symptom of a heart attack, which can be life-threatening. But it can also be a sign of heartburn, which has nothing to do with the heart and is a common symptom of indigestion.

It can sometimes be difficult to tell one from the other. Learning the difference can help you protect your heart health and know when to seek medical attention.

""If you're not sure if it's heartburn or a heart attack, and your chest pain is persistent seek medical help right away,"" says Kiyon Chung, MD, a Scripps cardiologist. ""You will be checked immediately to rule out a heart attack. If your chest pain turns out to be a heart attack, doctors will work to lessen any heart damage.""

If it's indigestion, you'll want to make sure it doesn't become a chronic problem. You may be able to find quick relief taking an over-the-counter antacid or other medication.
What is indigestion?
Heartburn is a symptom of indigestion or acid reflux. It happens when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, the food pipe that connects the throat to the stomach. This backflow causes a burning feeling or pain in the chest. Another symptom is regurgitation, which is when food rises in the back of the throat.

Many foods can trigger indigestion, including spicy foods. Other things you can do to prevent indigestion include cutting out alcohol, cigarettes, citrus, aspirin as well as eating close to bedtime or late at night.

Check with your doctor if you have recurring heartburn. You may have gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD. This is a chronic digestive condition that can lead to complications if left untreated.
What is a heart attack?
A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying the heart muscle with blood and oxygen is blocked. Blockage is often due to buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form plaque in the coronary arteries that feed the heart.

It can be difficult to tell heartburn from a heart attack largely because the esophagus is near the heart. But there are differences.
Symptoms of heart attack
The type of chest discomfort in a heart attack is different than what is typically experienced with indigestion.

The classic symptoms of a heart attack are:

* Crushing pain or pressure in the center of the chest
* Pain or tightness that spreads to the back, neck, shoulder, jaw, or arms
* Severe shortness of breath

People experiencing a heart attack may also experience sweating, toothache, headache, heartburn, nausea and vomiting.
Women and heart disease
Research shows that women can experience heart attacks differently than men.

A study in the scientific journal Circulation found only 30% of women had traditional chest pain symptoms. Many had other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, weakness, cold sweat, nausea, upset stomach or back pain.

""Since heart attack symptoms can often seem vague in women, many may not realize when they're having a heart attack and miss the chance to seek immediate, life-saving medical attention,"" says Dr. Chung.
When to call 911
If you think you are having a heart attack, call 911 or have someone make the call for you immediately. Getting to an emergency room as quickly as possible is important.

""The longer you delay treatment following the onset of symptoms, the greater the risk of damage to the heart and even death,"" Dr. Chung says.

""Don't brush off symptoms or wait to see if they get worse. Seek medical care right away.""",Narrative with Details </s> citing seemingly credible source </s> Highlighting Uncertainty and Risk </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility,true,"- Some symptoms of a heart attack are subtle and can be mistaken for indigestion </s> Is It Indigestion or Heart Attack?

Heartburn and heart attack pain can be similar, learn the difference
Chest discomfort is the most common symptom of a heart attack, which can be life-threatening.
But it can also be a sign of heartburn, which has nothing to do with the heart and is a common symptom of indigestion.
Learning the difference can help you protect your heart health and know when to seek medical attention.
""If you're not sure if it's heartburn or a heart attack, and your chest pain is persistent seek medical help right away,"" says Kiyon Chung, MD, a Scripps cardiologist.
""You will be checked immediately to rule out a heart attack.
If your chest pain turns out to be a heart attack, doctors will work to lessen any heart damage.""
Heartburn is a symptom of indigestion or acid reflux.
This backflow causes a burning feeling or pain in the chest.
It can be difficult to tell heartburn from a heart attack largely because the esophagus is near the heart.
Symptoms of heart attack
The type of chest discomfort in a heart attack is different than what is typically experienced with indigestion.
The classic symptoms of a heart attack are:
People experiencing a heart attack may also experience sweating, toothache, headache, heartburn, nausea and vomiting.
Research shows that women can experience heart attacks differently than men.
A study in the scientific journal Circulation found only 30% of women had traditional chest pain symptoms.
Many had other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, weakness, cold sweat, nausea, upset stomach or back pain.

Pepsi admits its soda contains cancer-causing ingredients
Thursday, September 15, 2016 by: Isabelle Z.
Tags: Pepsi, carcinogens, 4-Mel
(NaturalNews) When the Center for Environmental Health released test results showing that Pepsi intentionally covered up the presence of high levels of 4-Mel in its popular soft drinks in 2013, the company denied both the presence of this chemical in its beverages and the fact that it was dangerous. 4-Mel, which is short for 4-Methylimidazole, is a compound that is formed in the manufacturing of caramel coloring, and is a known carcinogen.

Since then, the drinks maker has fought against complying with California state requirements to place a cancer warning label on the beverages that contain the ingredient, which include not only Pepsi, but also Diet Pepsi and Pepsi One.

Now, a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Pepsi has gained preliminary approval from a federal judge in California. As part of the proposed settlement, Pepsi has agreed to ensure its caramel coloring's 4-Mel levels do not exceed 100 parts per billion in products that are being shipped for sale within the U.S. They will also be required to test the soda using specific protocols.

The soft drink giant also agreed to these measures in a different lawsuit that was settled in a California state court last year. The new settlement, however, expands the reach of these measures from California to the entire country.


Pepsi failed to warn consumers that its drinks contain known carcinogens
The lawsuit accused Pepsi of failing to warn people that its beverages contain 4-Mel, which California has officially recognized as a cancer-causing chemical.

A 2014 Consumer Reports test showed that the 4-Mel in Pepsi exceeded the permitted level of 29 micrograms per bottle or can, which would mean that they were in violation of common law and consumer protection statutes in the state of California.

In particular, this violates California's Proposition 65, which has been in place since 1985, and requires manufacturers to provide consumers with clear warnings when their products will expose them to toxic or cancer-causing chemicals.

The state's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment set the cutoff at 29 micrograms because that level creates a risk of cancer of one in 100,000.

Citing a 2013 Mintel and Leatherhead Food Research report, Consumer Reports said that caramel coloring is the world's most widely used food coloring. At the time, Pepsi tried to say that because Prop 65 refers to exposure per day rather than exposure per can, and that the average amount of diet soda that its drinkers consume daily is less than a can, there was no need to place a warning on it. Consumer Reports disagreed, however.

""No matter how much consumers drink they don't expect their beverages to have a potential carcinogen in them. And we don't think 4-MeI should be in foods at all. Our tests of Coke samples show that it is possible to get to much lower levels,"" toxicologist Dr. Urvashi Rangan said.


Is drinking soda really worth risking cancer and obesity?
It simply does not make sense for people to expose themselves unnecessarily to an ingredient that merely serves to color their food, and consumers have the right to be aware of what they are putting in their bodies. The popularity of books like Food Forensics serves to illustrate the growing desire by Americans to know what ingredients their food products contain.

The cancer-causing caramel coloring in Pepsi is not the only reason consumers should steer clear of it. Soft drinks are also believed to be behind the nation's obesity epidemic. A UCLA study found that adults who consumed one sugary drink such as a soda every day had a 27 percent higher likelihood of being classified as overweight than those who did not drink such beverages. Moreover, drinking just one soda each day adds up to a total of 39 pounds of sugar each year! That means that regular soda drinkers can cut their risk of obesity and cancer in one fell swoop simply by giving up the habit for good.

127,﻿snes-03188,Wheaties cereal sticks to magnets because it has metal flakes.,"Can Wheaties Really Stick To Magnets?
BY DEREK HELLING/JUNE 21, 2022 2:43 PM EDT
It's the Breakfast of Champions, but are Wheaties also a fun kids' science project that might make you question whether you want to actually eat the cereal, though? More specifically, do the flakes in Wheaties stick to magnets? General Mills has used sports figures to promote the iconic cereal but has not promoted the breakfast cereal as a way to play with magnets, although it does contain high amounts of a magnetically charged mineral: The cereal's nutrition facts say that one serving will supply you with 70% of your daily recommended allowance of iron.
Iron is necessary for a healthy diet, per Healthline, but imagine a cereal so laden with iron that it would actually stick to a magnet. Because Wheaties provide a lot of the essential nutrient, people have wondered if it's possible for magnets to pick up the cereal's flakes - some have even been curious enough about the phenomenon to try it out for themselves.
These opposites don't attract
So far, there is no documented evidence of magnets attracting Wheaties flakes like they would metal paperclips. My Recipes detailed one of the recent attempts to conduct this experiment and found that no matter how the magnets were positioned or how finely ground the flakes were, the magnets did not attract the cereal.
According to Daily Iron, every 100 grams of wheat boasts 3.8 milligrams of iron. While Wheaties lists wheat as its top ingredient, the amount of iron in each flake is still minuscule and apparently not enough to make the cereal magnetic. If that's a concern for you when choosing a breakfast cereal, fret not if you consider a box of Wheaties. While there are some cereals you should or shouldn't be eating, if you choose this one you aren't going to see any of the flakes sticking to a magnet in your home.

The ruling means that it should not be a scheduled drug - meaning that it is not a drug that has a high potential for abuse or is illegal to manufacture or distribute.
The WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence announced: ""Recent evidence from animal and human studies shows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to epilepsy and related conditions.
""Current evidence also shows that cannabidiol is not likely to be abused or create dependence as for other cannabinoids (such as Tetra Hydro Cannabinol (THC), for instance).""
The organization is now set to launch a more complete review in May of next year to look into cannabis and cannabis-related substances.
Currently, anyone found possessing cannabis can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both punishments under UK legislation.
Supplying or producing the Class B drug can land people in prison for a maximum of 14 years, an unlimited fine, or both.

131,﻿snes-00862,"In February and March 2018, hundreds of Canadian doctors signed a petition asking for the cancellation of pay deals from which they would personally benefit.","500 Canadian Doctors Protest Pay Raises Because They Already Make Too Much Money
Hundreds of Canadian doctors, medical specialists and residents, as well as medical students, have signed a petition protesting their own pay raises, instead asking that the money be reallocated to help nurses and patients in need.
""We, Quebec doctors who believe in a strong public system, oppose the recent salary increases negotiated by our medical federations,"" reads the letter, originally posted in French, the official language in the Canadian province.
More than 700 people have added their names to the petition since it was published on February 25. As of Tuesday, at least 213 general practitioners, 184 specialists, 149 resident medical doctors and 162 medical students had signed the petition, according to CNBC.
The doctors took umbrage with the pay bumps while nurses and clerks were over overburdened and patients faced declining services because of budget cuts to the public health care system.
""These increases are all the more shocking because our nurses, clerks and other professionals face very difficult working conditions, while our patients live with the lack of access to required services because of the drastic cuts in recent years and the centralization of power in the Ministry of Health,"" the letter said. ""The only thing that seems to be immune to the cuts is our remuneration.""

""We, Quebec doctors, are asking that the salary increases granted to physicians be canceled and that the resources of the system be better distributed for the good of the health care workers and to provide health services worthy to the people of Quebec,"" the letter said.
Canada offers ""universal coverage for medically necessary health care services provided on the basis of need, rather than the ability to pay,"" according to the government's website.
""We believe that there is a way to redistribute the resources of the Quebec health system to promote the health of the population and meet the needs of patients without pushing workers to the end,"" the doctors wrote.
The average Canadian physician in 2016 earned some $260,924, according to a September 2017 report from the Canadian Institute for Health Information. The institute clarified that this figure indicates gross pay and doesn't account for each doctor's overhead, it said in a statement to CNBC.
The group that published the February 25 petition, Médecins Québécois Pour le Régime (MQRP), also authored a February 17 letter opposing $500 million in pay increases for specialist doctors, calling the increase raises ""indecent.""
The latest letter comes after nurses held sit-ins to protest their working conditions. On February 1, the group of doctors published a letter of solidarity supporting their colleagues.
""The subject of nurses' work overload is at the heart of the news following the 'sit-ins,'"" MQRP wrote. ""MQRP joins its voices to those of nurses to denounce this unacceptable situation, which affects the quality of care for the Quebec population and weakens our public health system.""

132,﻿snes-05190,"Israel has banned the sale of Heinz brand ketchup, partially due to the product's use of GMO-derived ingredients","Heinz Ketchup Banned (And Why You Should Avoid It)
Israel has recently banned Heinz Ketchup from the country and they say it's because it doesn't have high enough amount of tomatoes in it. But there are a couple of more reasons why it was banned.
We know it's delicious but for your own sake stop consuming Heinz ketchup for good. In recent years people have started turning away from processed food and focusing more on healthy living and eating organic, raw food. This is a result of high toxins and chemical levels in processed food which is extremely unhealthy for our organism.
People have started avoiding processed food but they are unaware that the condiments they still use are considered processed and extremely unhealthy too. Ketchup is one of these unhealthy foods we have forgotten to rule out from our diet. Next time you think about eating ketchup turn the bottle and read the label, you'll be surprised of its contents. These are the 3 main reasons why you should stop consuming ketchup:
<b>  1. It contains high fructose corn syrup <b> 
Heinz is loaded with high fructose corn syrup which is extremely unhealthy. The corn syrup is made of GMO corn and this is what makes it so dangerous. It can cause a rapid increase in your blood sugar levels and damage your liver.
If you are a regular user of high fructose corn syrup it can lead to an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and obesity.
If you're still not convinced, we'll share the results of a recent study about high fructose corn syrup which revealed that it's loaded with mercury - a toxic heavy metal! Doctors are the first to advise you against eating foods which contain this hidden toxin!
<b>  2. It contains distilled vinegar and sugar <b>
Another fact about Heinz ketchup which you probably didn't know is that it contains distilled vinegar and sugar, which is another reason why you should ban in from your meals. Just one tablespoon of this ketchup contains 4 grams of sugar, and by adding it to your meals you're adding sugars without even knowing it.
Just like corn syrup, distilled vinegar derives from GMO corn. During growth GMO corn is treated with chemicals and pesticides and they end up on your plate through the ketchup. Consuming distilled vinegar and sugar which have GMO background has no benefits and is extremely dangerous for your health.
It's a fact that excessive sugar consumption without fibers or other beneficial ingredients can lead to decreased blood sugar levels and live and pancreas damages.
<b> 3. It has no nutritional value <b>
The third reason why you should stop using Heinz ketchup as a condiment is that there are no beneficial nutrients in it. It doesn't have fibers, proteins or other nutritive ingredients and the unnoticeable amount of tomato it contains has just slight traces of lycopene.
All that Heinz ketchup contains is sugar, GMOs and chemicals and has no benefit for your organism whatsoever. It's not just the ketchup, we are constantly using empty condiments which have no nutritional value but only harm our health.
If you truly want to live a healthy life and have a healthy body you need to buy GMO free and organic products. This will improve your health and make you feel better!

A 25-year old Singaporean woman is recovering in hospital after an attempted prank involving a photocopier backfired painfully for her yesterday afternoon.
According to local media reports, the woman was dared by her friends to strip naked and run inside a convenience store in Bishan. Once inside, she was to take a photocopy of her breasts using the store's machine.
Despite her initial reluctance, the woman agreed to the dare after her friends called her a coward. Speaking to the media, one her friends spoke of her regret for being involved in the incident.
""We thought it was just a harmless prank,"" she told journalists. ""If we knew she would get hurt, we would never had dared her to do it.""
The convenience store clerk, who witnessed the incident, told of his shock at seeing a naked woman running into the store. ""She ran past the counter and went straight to the photocopier,"" he said. ""I was too stunned to move, I've never seen something like that before.""
The clerk explained that he watched on, powerless to intervene as the woman lifted the tray of the photocopier and placed her breasts on the glass. ""It must have been cold because gave out a little cry as they touched the glass,"" he said. ""I yelled out to her, 'don't do it!', but she ignored me and pressed the 'copy' button.""
According to the clerk, there was a moment of silence as the copier's beam scanned across the woman's breasts. This was followed by a howl of pain. ""The woman started screaming and cursing,"" he said, and he quickly rushed to her aid.
""Her breasts were bright red,"" he told journalists. ""The beam of light from the copier must have burned them."" The clerk grabbed a bottle of water from a nearby fridge and splashed it over the woman's breasts. Her friends, who had been waiting outside, rushed into the store to see what was taking so long.
""We called for help immediately,"" said her friend who spoke to journalists. ""We were so shocked that she'd been burned by the copier. We didn't anticipate that at all."" The woman was rushed to hospital where doctors treated her burnt skin.
""We would strongly advise people to never place their body parts on a photocopier,"" said one of the medical team who treated the injured woman. ""In particular, sensitive areas such as the breasts or genitals are very susceptible to being burnt by the light emitted by copiers. There's also the risk of being electrocuted from the machine's high voltage wiring.""
For the woman involved in the incident, the medical staff are confident she'll make a quick recovery. ""The quick actions of the clerk by dousing her breasts in cold water should limit the extent of the burns,"" said a doctor.
For his role in helping the woman, the convenience store clerk is being hailed as a hero. ""I was just doing my job,"" he told journalists. ""As long as she makes a full recovery, that's all I am worried about.""

By Gerard du Cann, The Sun
September 10, 2018 | 11:00am | Updated
Drinking young people’s blood could help you live longer and prevent age-related diseases, a study has found.
Blood factors taken from younger animals have been found to improve the later-life health of older creatures.
The study, published in Nature, was conducted by researchers from University College London (UCL), who said it could reduce the chances of developing age-related disorders.
Geneticist Dame Linda Partridge said these included cancer and heart disease.
She told The Times: “I would say aging is the emperor of all diseases.”
“A lot of people regard aging as ‘natural’ and that therefore you shouldn’t interfere with nature. But we’ve always considered it an ethical imperative to cure illness where we find it.”
The research is part of a wave of studies and trials backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel at a San Francisco start-up called Ambrosia.
Separate trials by Ambrosia involved 70 participants, all 35 or older.
After being given plasma — the main component of blood — from volunteers ages 16 to 25, researchers noted improvements in biomarkers for various diseases.
Ambrosia currently offers teenage blood plasma to customers at a cost of $8,000 for 2½ liters.
The UCL trials showed older mice did not develop age-related diseases after being given young blood.
The mice also maintained sharp cognitive function.

138,﻿tron-01445,Beaver Butts Emit Goo for Vanilla Flavoring,"Beaver Butts Emit Goo Used for Vanilla Flavoring
BYMOLLIE BLOUDOFF-INDELICATO
PUBLISHED OCTOBER 1, 2013
• 3 MIN READ
Just in time for holiday cookie season, we've discovered that the vanilla flavoring in your baked goods and candy could come from the anal excretions of beavers.
Beaver butts secrete a goo called castoreum, which the animals use to mark their territory. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists castoreum as a ""generally regarded as safe"" additive, and manufacturers have been using it extensively in perfumes and foods for at least 80 years, according to a 2007 study in the International Journal of Toxicology.
""I lift up the animal's tail,"" said Joanne Crawford, a wildlife ecologist at Southern Illinois University, ""and I'm like, 'Get down there, and stick your nose near its bum.'""
""People think I'm nuts,"" she added. ""I tell them, 'Oh, but it's beavers; it smells really good.'""
Castoreum is a chemical compound that mostly comes from a beaver's castor sacs, which are located between the pelvis and the base of the tail. Because of its close proximity to the anal glands, castoreum is often a combination of castor gland secretions, anal gland secretions, and urine.
The fragrant, brown slime is about the consistency of molasses, though not quite as thick, Crawford said.
While most anal secretions stink-due to odor-producing bacteria in the gut-this chemical compound is a product of the beaver's unique diet of leaves and bark, Crawford added.
Instead of smelling icky, castoreum has a musky, vanilla scent, which is why food scientists like to incorporate it in recipes.
Save a Cow, Milk a Beaver
But getting a beaver to produce castoreum for purposes of food processing is tough. Foodies bent on acquiring some of the sticky stuff have to anesthetize the animal and then ""milk"" its nether regions. (Read about scientists who milk mice.)
""You can milk the anal glands so you can extract the fluid,"" Crawford said. ""You can squirt [castoreum] out. It's pretty gross.""
Due to such unpleasantness for both parties, castoreum consumption is rather small-only about 292 pounds (132 kilograms) yearly. That statistic includes castoreum, castoreum extract, and castoreum liquid, according to Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients.
Still concerned you're chowing down on beaver-bum goop? Because of its FDA label, in some cases, manufacturers don't have to list castoreum on the ingredient list and may instead refer to it as ""natural flavoring.""

140,﻿tron-01791,Health Warnings About Flouroquinolone Antibiotics,"THIS ANTIBIOTIC WILL RUIN YOU.
Posted by Erin Elizabeth | Mar 24, 2017
If you've not heard of the class of antibiotics called ""Fluoroquinolones,"" you want to. Trust me. After taking a round of Cipro in 2010, for a UTI, Amy Moser's life was forever changed and she's now writing in the hopes that someone, anyone, will read her story and be saved from the hell this class of drugs has wrecked on her body.
She writes that after taking that round in 2010 she experienced, ""Multiple spontaneous tendon and ligament ruptures, spinal degeneration, and arthritis that is widespread. We are talking multiple joint dislocations and surgeries to most of my large joints and spine. Twenty surgeries in the last 7 years if you wanna count.""
But just what are these drugs? They go by many names, Cipro, Levaquin, Avalox, basically every generic ending in ""quin"", ""oxacin,"" or ""ox."" While the FDA has now updated their warning on these antibiotics (July 2016) siting, ""multiple system damage that may be irreversible,"" people are still taking them and though the info is there, no one is warning us. So, as I always say, you MUST educate yourself:  https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm500143.htm. 
Fluoroquinolones were intended to be a last resort type of drug when all other options failed. That means if you had a UTI and you were allergic to penicillin- they still would have found something else to give you. But as we all know, it's so, so easy to just write a script. Trying to figure out the underlying cause takes more time and doesn't pay as well.
[Video title: The Dangers of Fluoroquinolones] 
The reason they were supposed to be a last resort is because of the severe damage they do to the body; they actually damage the DNA mitochondrial repair cells (the cells that heal any damage to the body). So, if you take these drugs you are effectually damaging the very cells that are supposed to repair damaged cells and tissue. Flouroquinolones are also able to cross the blood-brain barrier which can result in psychiatric events, depression, and suicidal thoughts.
And one last bomb, the damage is cumulative. ""The more exposures you have to these antibiotics, the more damage is done to your body. Not just for some people, ALL people. A hundred percent of people who take a Fluoroquinolone antibiotic, show changes in blood flow to the tendon, cartilage, and ligament in their bodies. Each person has a different breaking point depending on their own unique DNA. Some people fall apart or die after 1 pill. I fell apart after my 4th round of Fluoroquinolone antibiotics in my life and some people are on their 25th round and are still oblivious to what is happening inside them until they break. It might not even be a physical one. It may be a psychotic one. By then, it's too late. The damage is done. There is no cure. No treatment. No relief. No specialist even.""
Our hearts go out to Amy, we cannot imagine what she's been through, but we are so thankful for her story. Check out the links below for more info on these dangerous antibiotics:

141,﻿snes-04766,Dryer sheets permeated with fabric softener contain at least seven dangerous toxic chemicals.,"Dryer sheets cause hormone imbalance, neurotoxicity, respiratory problems, and even cancer
April 11, 2016 By Admin
Most commercial dryer sheets are loaded with all sorts of toxic chemicals including Benzyl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Chloroform and Linalool; none of which are good for your health. In addition to all the chemicals that end up on your skin, when heated, the fumes are also toxic.  These toxins go straight to their brain's most sensitive neurological centers and wreck havoc.
5 Killer Reasons to Ditch Dryer Sheets
Artificial Fragrances
When people use dryer sheets, they are coating their cloths with  artificial chemical perfumes. These fragrance chemical are really toxic chemicals. They are known carcinogens that cause liver damage and cancer in mammals. (study)
In a recent study performed by UW professor Dr. Anne Steinemann, a research team conducted a small study to understand the effects of fragrances in laundry products (both detergent and dryer sheets). The resultsd discovered  more than 25 VOCs emitted from dryer vents, with highest concentrations of acetaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol (two of which are considered carcinogenic). To put it in context, one of the carcinogenic VOC's, acetaldehyde, had emissions that would represent 3% of total acetaldehyde emissions from automobiles in the study area. This is a major omission of toxic chemicals.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and industry-generated Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) from the 1990s, the following is a list of chemicals in fabric softener products, most in untested combinations.
1.  Alpha-Terpineol-This chemical has been linked to disorders of the brain and nervous system, loss of muscle control, depression, and headaches
2.  Benzyl acetate-Benzyl acetate has been linked to cancer of the pancreas
3.  Benzyl alcohol-This upper respiratory tract irritant can cause central nervous system (CNS) disorders, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and dramatic drops in blood pressure.
4.  Chloroform-Neurotoxic, anesthetic and carcinogenic. Really toxic to your brain. Inhaling its vapors may cause loss of consciousness, nausea, headache, vomiting, and/or dizziness, drowsiness.
5.  Ethanol- Another fabric softener ingredient which is on the EPA's Hazardous Waste list and linked to CNS disorders.
6.  Ethyl Acetate-causes headaches and is on the EPA Hazardous Waste list
7.  Linalool-in studies, this chemical caused loss of muscle coordination, nervous system and brain disorders, and depression
8.  Pentane-causes headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, and depression

Their bone structure is dramatically shrunk to get more meat out of them. This is great for KFC.
Because they do not have to pay so much for their production costs. There is no more plucking of the feathers or the removal of the beaks and feet. The government has told them to change all of their menus so they do not say chicken anywhere. If you look closely you will notice this.

148,﻿snes-02855,"Several brands of baby wipes available in the U.S. were recalled in 2017 because they pose a risk of serious infection.	
Original","10 brands of baby wipes recalled due to pneumonia-causing bacteria contamination
(NaturalNews) Ten brands of baby wipes produced by the Pennsylvania-based Nutek Disposables, Inc., were recalled on January 25, 2017, following complaints of foul odor and discoloration.
Upon further testing, the baby wipe and adult washcloth manufacturer discovered that some of their products contained Burkholderia cepacia, a species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria frequently found in soil and water, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Known for its vinegar-like odor, B. cepacia has emerged as a human respiratory pathogen in people with weakened immune systems or chronic lung disease, especially cystic fibrosis patients.
Pulmonary infections involving these bacteria are capable of causing accelerated decline in lung functions and can induce ""cepacia syndrome,"" a progressive form of pneumonia that can be fatal and untreatable, according to MicrobeWiki.
Resistant bacteria found in baby wipes prompts mass recall
""After receiving a small number of complaints of odor and discoloration, Nutek conducted microbial testing that showed the presence of a bacteria, called Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia), in some of these products,"" according to the company's press release.
""Soon after, on January 3, 2017 the company initiated a voluntary withdrawal of lots that had tested positive for the bacteria, as well as other baby wipes in the surrounding time frame. After some additional lots were tested, as a precautionary measure, Nutek believed it was a prudent decision to withdraw all its baby wipe products.""
The following brands are included in the nationwide recall:
* Cuties
* Diapers.com
* Femtex
* Fred's
* Kidgets
* Member's Mark
* Simply Right
* Sunny Smiles
* Tender Touch
* Well Beginnings
The baby wipe brands are sold at a variety of retailers including Walgreen's, Family Dollar, Sam's Club and internet retailer Diapers.com. Reports confirm that some of the packages distributed prior to January 21, 2017, contained B. cepacia, prompting the company to halt shipping of all baby wipes produced at the facility.
Before October 3, Nutek Disposables says they only received one report of irritation; however, many more complaints emerged following the recall announcement.
Consumers reported side effects including rash, irritation, infections, fever, gastrointestinal issues and respiratory issues; however, these reports ""have not been confirmed to be related to the use of these products,"" according to Nutek officials.
The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the company is still unable to determine the cause of the problem but is continuing to investigate, and the administration will work closely with Nutek to communicate the issue with affected retailers and distributors.

Mouthwash and contaminated medical equipment tied to previous B. cepacia infections
This isn't the first time a personal care product has been contaminated with B. cepacia. In 2005, the CDC learned that several states had clusters of pneumonia and other infections caused by the bacteria, which ended up being connected to contaminated mouthwash.
Over-the-counter nasal spray was linked to B. cepacia infections in 2004, while that same year medical equipment and solutions used for intensive care unit patients were associated with the gram-negative bacteria.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be transferred by direct contact with contaminated surfaces, exposure to B. cepacia in the environment and through person-to-person contact, according to the CDC.
Good hand hygiene and infection-control practices are recommended for successfully preventing infection from this bacterium.

150,﻿snes-04082,You should avoid eating green potatoes because they are poisonous.,"The Claim: Green Potatoes Are Poisonous
By Anahad O'Connor
* July 3, 2007
<b> THE FACTS <b>
It sounds like a joke, or perhaps just an urban legend that grew out of Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham."" But food scientists say this one is no myth. The reality is that green potatoes contain high levels of a toxin, solanine, which can cause nausea, headaches and neurological problems.
Potatoes naturally produce small amounts of solanine as a defense against insects, but the levels increase with prolonged exposure to light and warm temperatures.
The green color is actually caused by high levels of chlorophyll, which by itself is harmless. But it is also a sign that levels of solanine, which is produced at the same time as chlorophyll, have increased as well.
According to a recent report by Alexander Pavlista, a professor of agronomy and horticulture at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, a 100-pound person would have to eat about 16 ounces of a fully green potato to get sick. That is the weight of a large baked potato.
The report noted that most green potatoes never reach the market. Still, to avoid the development of solanine, it is best to store potatoes in cool, dimly lit areas, and to cut away green areas before eating.
Another good rule: if it tastes bitter, don't eat it. Unlike Dr. Seuss's entree, this green meal would not have a happy ending.

* Blue morning glory and hawaiian baby woodrose are sold in garden stores
* But police warn the natural products are being used by teens to get high
* They produce the same effects as LSD when drunk in tea or swallowed
* Teens in Massachusetts have been hospitalized after eating the seeds  By MIA DE GRAAF FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  PUBLISHED: 11:59 EST, 5 May 2016 | UPDATED: 13:04 EST, 5 May 2016

Flower seeds are the new party drug, police are warning. 
Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, Sleepy Grass, and Blue Morning Glory are sold in garden stores to grow climbing vines, long grass, and flowers.
But there has been a surge teenagers across America crushing up and swallowing the legal products to replicate the effects of LSD.
This week, Massachusetts police issued a warning to parents after a number of teenagers were hospitalized with extreme psychotic reactions in Seekonk, near Providence, Rhode Island.
And now Home Depot stores in the area are pulling the seeds from shelves in a bid to curb the situation.
The seeds contain LSA (lysergic acid amide), a hallucinogen similar to LSD. 
When swallowed whole or crushed into tea, they affect a person's sight, vision, and sense of time, often making them feel extreme euphoria and extreme fatigue. 
Like LSD, it can also provoke psychotic episodes, flashbacks, overwhelming paranoia, and vomiting.
Seekonk Police Chief Craig Mace said investigators have found the seeds on high school and middle school campuses across the town. 
It is hardly the first instance of people using natural products to induce a high, he warns. 
'We as human beings have a tendency to come up with different ways to become impaired, or however you want to describe it,' Mace said in a statement on the department's Facebook page.
'Here we have a natural product that's intended for ornamental purposes, and somehow, someone figured out that it could cause a hallucinogenic effect,' he continued.
'Parents should know if their children are into planting flowers or not, so if they see these things in the household, the radar should be on, the red flag should go up.'
Though purchasing the seeds is legal, extracting the LSA is illegal.  
Hawaiian Baby Woodrose is a yellow/light brown seed which grows in a furry pod. 
Native to South America and Africa, the seeds can be planted to grow invasive but beautiful leafy vines.
The seeds' psychotic properties were first recorded in the 1960s.
Blue Morning Glory seeds are planted to grow delicate blue-and-white flowers. 
The seeds are black. Drug users crush them or lick them to induce a psychotic high. 
Sleepy Grass seeds looks like pieces of buckwheat. They grow long grass on dry soil, like that commonly seen across the plains of the Midwest and in the arid South West like Arizona.

158,﻿snes-01547,"Manuka honey, as a topical treatment, is better than all known antibiotics.","Study: Manuka honey kills more bacteria than all available antibiotics
Not all honey is created equal. While the benefits of raw, unprocessed honey have been well-documented over the centuries, Australian researchers have found one type of honey, called Manuka honey, to be better than all known antibiotics.
Manuka honey is produced by bees that forage on the nectar of Leptospermum Scoparium, or New Zealand's Manuka bush, as well as tea trees, native to Australia and New Zealand only.
This remarkable type of honey not only effectively kills bacteria, but none of the bugs killed by it have been able to build up immunity. In a world where many of the last resort antibiotics are failing against antibiotic-resistant superbugs, Manuka honey may hold the key to fighting resistance issues, saving thousands of lives worldwide.
Manuka honey fights superbugs
Dr. Dee Carter from the University of Sydney's School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences noted that antibiotics not only have short shelf lives, but the bacteria they attack quickly become resistant as well, making them useless over time.
The report, published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, claimed that Manuka honey killed almost every bacteria and pathogen it was tested on. Unlike all antibiotics available on today's market, none of the bugs tested were able to survive the honey treatment.
According to Dr. Carter, there are particular compounds, like methylglyoxal, in the Manuka honey that cause multi-system failure in the bacteria, killing them before they are able to adapt and build up immunity.
What Manuka honey can do for you
Manuka's biological properties range from antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antibiotic and wound healing, to immune-stimulatory. However, what separates Manuka honey from the rest is that its antibacterial powers challenge even the toughest superbugs, such as the life-threatening methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Manuka honey is marketed for cancer treatment and prevention, high cholesterol, chronic inflammation, diabetes, the treatment of gastrointestinal problems, and eye, ear and sinus infections. However, it might be most useful in treating skin wounds and leg ulcers.
According to one study, published in the scientific journal Peer J, chronic wounds are becoming a major global health problem, due to antibiotic resistance issues. They are costly and difficult to treat, and bacterial biofilms are important contributors to the delay in healing. There is an urgent need for new, effective agents in topical wound care, and honey has shown some great potential in this regard.
For their study, researchers reviewed Manuka honey in particular as an alternative treatment for wounds because of its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and the inability of bacteria to develop resistance to it. Their study indicated that honey might prevent bacterial biofilms and eliminate established biofilms. Furthermore, they reported that Manuka honey could successfully be used to kill all MSSA and MRSA biofilms in a chronic wound, supporting the use of this type of honey as an effective topical treatment for chronic wound infections.
In recent years, word of the biological benefits of Manuka honey has spread to every corner of the world, turning it into one of the most popular superfoods out there. Its fame and the over-demand, however, have caused shortages, resulting in fake, usually cheaper, products to enter the market. So, if you are going to spend your money on honey to reap its benefits, make sure you are buying the real thing.",rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical or scientific jargon </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> Inappropriate Use of Scientific and Other Evidence - out of context_verified </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility,false,"Manuka honey, as a topical treatment, is better than all known antibiotics. </s> Study: Manuka honey kills more bacteria than all available antibiotics

Several deliveries of bananas from Uvongo Kwa-Zulu Natal South Africa have been infected with necrotizing fasciitis, otherwise known as flesh eating bacteria. Recently this disease has decimated the monkey population in the south coast. We are now just learning that the disease has been able to graft itself to the skin of fruits in the region, most notably the banana which is one of south africa's largest exports. Until this finding scientists were not sure how the infection was being transmitted. It is advised not to purchase bananas for the next three weeks!!! If you have eaten a banana in the last 2-3 days and come down with a fever followed by a skin infection seek MEDICAL ATTENTION!!!
The skin infection from necrotizing fasciitis is very painful and eats two to three centimeters of flesh per hour. Amputation is likely, death is possible.. If you are more than an hour from a medical center burning the flesh ahead of the infected area is advised to help slow the spread of the infection.

By ABC7
Wednesday, May 7, 2014
ALBANY, Calif.
Seven-year-old Baylor Fredrickson is bi-racial, and while there are more than 10 million bone marrow donors in the national registry, only about 400,000 are mixed race. And because donors ideally need to be ethnically similar, finding a life-saver is daunting.
Baylor, who is battling leukemia, loves math, Greek mythology and sports. A video by the Asian American Donor Program is one of the ways the family is reaching out.
Baylor needs a bone marrow transplant and his sister Maddie is not a match. Their parents are Japanese and German, so a mixed race donor -- Asian and Caucasian -- would be ideal, but so far a worldwide search has come up empty.
For more than two decades Asian American Donor Program spokesperson Jonathan Leong has tried to encourage more people to step up.
""The number one thing is, 'it doesn't pertain to me, I don't have a family member, I'm not affected,'"" Leong explained. ""It doesn't hit you until it hits close to home and that's the sad part.""
Rob Fredrickson is Baylor's dad. His son endured chemotherapy two years ago that they thought had eradicated the leukemia. Now only a bone marrow transplant will do.
And he says Baylor knows finding a donor is a challenge.
""He's spoken to us about the possibility that he may pass away,"" Rob said. ""He's well aware of his own situation.""
But at the same time the family is not giving up hope. There's a concerted effort to increase the number of minority donors in the national registry. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and Olympic skater Kristi Yamaguchi are involved in public awareness campaigns.
""If it's not Baylor's life, it might be another patient,"" Rob Fredrickson said.

Seven-year-old Baylor Fredrickson is bi-racial, and while there are more than 10 million bone marrow donors in the national registry, only about 400,000 are mixed race.
And because donors ideally need to be ethnically similar, finding a life-saver is daunting.
A video by the Asian American Donor Program is one of the ways the family is reaching out.
Baylor needs a bone marrow transplant and his sister Maddie is not a match.
Their parents are Japanese and German, so a mixed race donor -- Asian and Caucasian -- would be ideal, but so far a worldwide search has come up empty.
For more than two decades Asian American Donor Program spokesperson Jonathan Leong has tried to encourage more people to step up.
""The number one thing is, 'it doesn't pertain to me, I don't have a family member, I'm not affected,'"" Leong explained.
Rob Fredrickson is Baylor's dad.
Now only a bone marrow transplant will do.
And he says Baylor knows finding a donor is a challenge.
There's a concerted effort to increase the number of minority donors in the national registry.
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and Olympic skater Kristi Yamaguchi are involved in public awareness campaigns.
""If it's not Baylor's life, it might be another patient,"" Rob Fredrickson said.

* Oct. 12, 2014
DALLAS - A nurse here became the first person to contract Ebola within the United States, prompting local, state and federal officials who had settled into a choreographed response to scramble on Sunday to solve the mystery of how she became infected, despite wearing protective gear, and to monitor additional people possibly at risk.
The news further stoked fears of health care workers across the country, many of whom have grown increasingly anxious about having to handle Ebola cases. The confirmation on Sunday of the second Ebola case in Dallas - four days after the death on Wednesday of the first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, a Liberian who arrived in this country in September - opened a new and more frightening chapter in the unfolding public health drama.
While the new Ebola patient was not publicly identified, officials said that she was a nurse who had helped treat Mr. Duncan at a hospital here and that she may have violated safety protocols. It was the first confirmed instance of Ebola being transmitted in this country. Officials expanded the pool of people they had been monitoring, because the nurse had not been among the 48 health care workers, relatives of Mr. Duncan and others whom they were evaluating daily.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that health officials look more closely at the protective gear that nurses, doctors and hospital assistants use when treating Ebola patients. It also, for the first time, was considering the idea that patients with the virus should be transferred to hospitals with special containment units and experience in treating the disease.
The Dallas hospital at the center of the two Ebola cases, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, was facing renewed scrutiny over whether it had properly trained its workers. It sent Mr. Duncan home on Sept. 25 under the belief he had a sinus infection, only to have him return Sept. 28 when his conditions worsened.
The C.D.C. said it would conduct a nationwide training conference call on Tuesday for thousands of health care workers to ensure they would be fully prepared to treat a patient with Ebola.
""The care of Ebola patients can be done safely, but it's hard to do it safely,"" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., told reporters Sunday. ""Even a single, inadvertent innocent slip can result in contamination.""
The stricken nurse reported a low-grade fever overnight Friday, officials said. It appeared that she drove herself to the emergency room of Presbyterian Hospital, where she worked, and was admitted and put in isolation 90 minutes later, the officials said.

She had extensive contact with Mr. Duncan on multiple occasions after his second visit and admission to the hospital on Sept. 28, Dr. Frieden said.
The nurse had been monitoring herself for symptoms of Ebola, under a regimen prescribed by the C.D.C. Health officials will now investigate who had been in contact with Mr. Duncan after he was admitted to the hospital and while he was in isolation, Dr. Frieden said.
Before her trip to the emergency room, officials said, the nurse had not been at work for two days. A preliminary blood test was done at the state public health lab in Austin, and the positive result was received late Saturday evening, officials said. Late Sunday afternoon, the C.D.C. confirmed that she had Ebola after completing its own tests.
The woman was in stable condition on Sunday. Dr. Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, which oversees Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, told reporters on Sunday that the worker had worn protective gear when coming in contact with Mr. Duncan, although he did not detail the type of contact.

""This individual was following full C.D.C. precautions,"" Dr. Varga said, adding, ""Gown, glove, mask and shield."" Asked how concerned he was that the worker tested positive despite the precautions, he replied, ""We're very concerned.""
Despite Dr. Varga's reassurances about C.D.C. precautions having been followed, Dr. Frieden said it appeared that the woman had breached safety protocol at the hospital, possibly when removing the protective gear. Speaking on the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" and later at a news conference, he said that questioning of the worker had not identified precisely how a breach occurred, and that the cause of her infection was not known. Dr. Frieden said that everyone who had treated Mr. Duncan was now considered to be potentially exposed and that other cases of Ebola were possible.
""We're deeply concerned about this new development,"" he said on the talk show.
The C.D.C. has said that for health workers in the United States, gloves, gowns, masks and face shields or goggles would be protection enough. But many health workers across the country, seeing images of people in Africa completely encased in full-body hazardous-material suits, have requested similar protection.
""A lot of us are starting to get worried,"" said Debra Buccellato, an emergency room nurse in Santa Rosa, Calif. ""I'm a single mom, so if I got sick there'd be a huge void.""

Ms. Buccellato, 38, said supervisors at her hospital had distributed information about C.D.C. guidelines, but added, ""I have not seen any active training or practice drills, and I haven't seen any new or upgraded personal protective equipment.""
She said that she had emailed her manager to ask for more training, but that she was not sure that hazardous-material suits were the best option for her 90-bed facility, Sutter Santa Rosa Hospital.
""I don't know how realistic it is to go to that level when you have X amount of patients to take care of and time issues,"" Ms. Buccellato said. For now, she said, she plans to start wearing a face mask for her entire shift.
On Sunday, National Nurses United, the country's largest union and professional association of nurses, continued to sound the alarm and call for hazardous-material suits at all hospitals.

""I'm angry about this,"" said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director. ""We want the first line of defense to be the most prepared. Our hospitals are resisting us. The C.D.C. doesn't say that we need hazmat suits. If this doesn't change dramatically, we will picket every hospital in this country if we have to.""
President Obama on Sunday directed the C.D.C. to expedite its investigation into how the health care worker contracted the deadly virus, according to a White House statement.
In an indication that the White House was taking steps in advance of any possible spread of the disease, Mr. Obama also directed federal officials to make sure that hospitals and health workers across the nation ""are prepared to follow protocols should they encounter an Ebola patient,"" the statement said. Mr. Obama was briefed by Lisa Monaco, the president's assistant for homeland security, and then spoke by telephone with Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services.
While other patients with Ebola have been treated in the United States in recent weeks, the nurse is only the second person - after Mr. Duncan - whose condition was diagnosed in the United States. All of the other patients - including medical personnel, relief workers and journalists - received a diagnosis while working in West Africa near Ebola victims, and were brought to this country for treatment.
Four hospitals in the United States - Emory University Hospital in Atlanta; Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha; the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.; and St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Mont. - have high-containment units for isolating patients with dangerous infectious diseases, and medical teams at those facilities have conducted extensive training and drills for dealing with pathogens like Ebola.
But in Dallas on Sunday, officials were trying to persuade residents to remain calm, and reminded them that their risk of exposure was low.
""You cannot contract Ebola other than from the bodily fluids of a symptomatic Ebola victim,"" said County Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County's chief executive, who himself has had close contact with those who lived with Mr. Duncan. ""You cannot contract Ebola by walking by people on the street or by being around contacts who are not symptomatic. There's nothing about this case that changes that basic premise of science.""
City officials moved swiftly to clean and decontaminate many of the places where the nurse had been or had even briefly touched, including her apartment in a complex on Marquita Avenue, the complex's common areas and the car she took to the hospital. Police officers were prohibiting access to her apartment. Officials believe the woman's pet dog was inside the apartment, but was doing fine.

""We have a plan in place to take care of the pet, and we do not believe that pet has any signs, and we'll move accordingly later today,"" Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas said.
Remaining calm was easier said than done for many of the woman's neighbors. Early Sunday, city officials knocked on the doors of nearby homes and called residences in the four blocks surrounding the complex to inform people that someone who lived in the neighborhood had tested positive for Ebola.
""It's a little creepy,"" said Kara Lutley, 25, who lives across the street from the nurse's apartment building. ""It's been in Dallas, but it hasn't been this close.""
At the hospital, the car the woman arrived in was decontaminated and secured so no one could go near it, officials said. ""We decontaminated hand railings, everything in the parking lot, so everybody can feel comfortable that the exterior was taken care of,"" Mr. Rawlings said.
The hospital also took the unusual step on Sunday of prohibiting ambulances from bringing new patients into its emergency room. Officials said that the hospital was open, but that they had decided to put the emergency room on so-called diversion status because of staff limitations. ""While we are on diversion we are also using this time to further expand the margin of safety by triple-checking our full compliance with updated C.D.C. guidelines,"" hospital officials said in a statement. ""We are also continuing to monitor all staff who had some relation to Mr. Duncan's care even if they are not assumed to be at significant risk of infection.""",anger </s> Highlighting Uncertainty and Risk </s> Narrative with details_details verified to be true </s> anxiety </s> emotional appeals </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> fear </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility,true,"Ebola is Spreading in the U.S. with a 2nd Confirmed Case </s> DALLAS - A nurse here became the first person to contract Ebola within the United States, prompting local, state and federal officials who had settled into a choreographed response to scramble on Sunday to solve the mystery of how she became infected, despite wearing protective gear, and to monitor additional people possibly at risk.

Let's say it's 4:17 p.m. and you're driving home, (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.  Not only was the work load extraordinarily heavy, you also had a disagreement with your boss, and no matter how
hard you tried, he just wouldn't see your side of the situation. You're really upset and the more you think about it, the more up-tight you become.

All of a sudden you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw.  You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your home, but unfortunately you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far. What can you do?

You've been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the course neglected to tell you how to perform it on yourself.

HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE (since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article seemed in order.)

Without help - the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to feel faint has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.   However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously.

A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.  A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.

Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.  The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm.  In this way, heart attack victims can get to a phone and, between breaths, call for help.

Tell as many other people as possible about this, it could save their lives!

There's yet another use for marijuana: It may help to heal broken bones, according to a new study.
Researchers found that cannabidiol - an element of marijuana that does not get people high - improved the healing process in rats with broken leg bones after eight weeks, according to a study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research by Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University.
Yankel Gabet of Tel Aviv's Bone Research Laboratory who led the study, said it found that the element ""makes bones stronger during healing,"" which could prevent future fractures. This process occurs as cannabidiol, or CBD, enhances the maturation of collagen, the protein in connective tissue that ""holds the body together.""
""After being treated with CBD, the healed bone will be harder to break in the future,"" Gabet said in a news release.
The results of the study provide another glimpse into the potential health benefits of marijuana. Medicinal marijuana is already used to reduce some of the effects associated with chemotherapy in cancer patients. It is also used as treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
In earlier research, Gabet's team learned that the body's cannabinoid receptors ""stimulated bone formation and inhibited bone loss."" Those findings open doors to how marijuana could treat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases, the researchers say.
Marijuana is still largely illegal across the world and in the United States. But marijuana prescribed for medical uses is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug ""with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"" alongside heroin and LSD. Although that classification is unlikely to change this year, attempts and events that challenge marijuana's status in the nation have not gone unnoticed.
According to Gabet, ""there is still a lot of work to be done to develop appropriate therapies"" in using marijuana medically, but ""it is possible to detach a clinical therapy objective"" from the mood-changing aspects of the stoner's plant.
""The clinical potential of cannabinoid-related compounds is simply undeniable at this point.""",title of article as clickbait </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility,true,"Scientific studies support the conclusion that marijuana can play a role in healing broken bones </s> Another medical use for pot: Healing broken bones

It's Britain's 'most dangerous plant'

Brits are being urged to take extra care around 'Britain's most dangerous plant', giant hogweed. Prevalent at this time of year, the toxic flowering plant has been causing horrendous blistering burns on both adults and children.
While giant hogweed usually grows near waterways, experts have explained they are losing a battle to eradicate its presence, after homeowners have spotted the plant popping up in their parks and gardens. It might look harmless, but this invasive plant harbours toxic sap on its stems - and can be extremely dangerous when it comes into contact with bare skin.
Over in Bolton, one primary school girl suffered second-degree burns after touching the plant while playing in a park. She suffered severe blistering on her hands and was admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, one man in Cornwall was left unable to walk after feeling like he was ""on fire"" after coming into contact with the plant.
""After that it was absolutely excruciating pain in my calf muscle; my skin was literally feeling like it was on fire,"" he told The Metro. ""The best I could do was get myself to the toilet or the bathroom, I've spent a lot of time in bed, a lot of time sleeping. I can't stand even now for very long. Walking is getting a little easier.""
With the weather warming up, experts have expressed new fears that giant hogweed will spread further. One Facebook post read: ""Now is the season for 'Britain's most dangerous plant' and with the lovely weather forecast in a couple of weeks time, this stuff will thrive and spread.
""Any parts of the body that come into contact with the sap of a giant hogweed should be immediately washed with soap and cold water and seek medical advice. Further exposure to sunlight should be avoided for at least 48 hours.""
This content is imported from Facebook. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.
Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), previously told The Times that flooding has meant the plant's seeds have spread to previously untouched areas.
He also warned people to take extra care if they have spotted it growing: ""It can cause some very nasty injuries which take a long time to heal. The beast has purple blotches and coarse hairs on its stems. In most places where you see it in summer, it is enormous.
""It's a very pretty plant but I would strongly advise anyone not to grow it. It can cause some very nasty injuries which take a long time to heal.""
Giant hogweed was first introduced to the UK in the 1980s as an ornamental plant, but quickly spread across the country. It is also very invasive, over-powering other flowers in the same area and reducing wildlife, too.
What happens if you touch the plant?
It's a flowering plant in the same family as carrots. Giant hogweed typically grows to a height of around two to five metres. Serious reactions to the skin are caused by 'furocoumarin derivatives' in its stems, leaves, roots and seeds.
It can lead to skin inflammation and blisters, with a reaction to the plant happening around 15 minutes after first coming into contact with it.
Children should take extra care, especially when playing outside in overgrown areas. It can easily be mistaken as a harmless plant, so young children can unknowingly pick the flowering heads without realising.

More serious cases include people having long-term sensitivity to sunlight after touching the plant, as well as blindness if it comes into contact with the eyes.
As well as growing wild in the countryside, it is also known to flower in gardens if they are left unkept.

Researchers at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Canada have cured cancer last week, yet there is a little ripple in the news or in TV. It is a simple technique using very basic drug. The method employs dichloroacetate, which is currently used to treat metabolic disorders. So, there is no concern of side effects or about their long term effects.
This drug doesn't require a patent, so anyone can employ it widely and cheaply compared to the costly cancer drugs produced by major pharmaceutical companies.
Canadian scientists tested this dichloroacetate (DCA) on human's cells; it killed lung, breast and brain cancer cells and left the healthy cells alone. It was tested on Rats inflicted with severe tumors; their cells shrank when they were fed with water supplemented with DCA. The drug is widely available and the technique is easy to use, why the major drug companies are not involved? Or the Media interested in this find?
In human bodies there is a natural cancer fighting human cell, the mitochondria, but they need to be triggered to be effective. Scientists used to think that these mitochondria cells were damaged and thus ineffective against cancer. So they used to focus on glycolysis, which is less effective in curing cancer and more wasteful. The drug manufacturers focused on this glycolysis method to fight cancer. This DCA on the other hand doesn't rely on glycolysis instead on mitochondria; it triggers the mitochondria which in turn fights the cancer cells.
The side effect of this is it also reactivates a process called apoptosis. You see, mitochondria contain an all-too-important self-destruct button that can't be pressed in cancer cells. Without it, tumors grow larger as cells refuse to be extinguished. Fully functioning mitochondria, thanks to DCA, can once again die.
With glycolysis turned off, the body produces less lactic acid, so the bad tissue around cancer cells doesn't break down and seed new tumors.
Pharmaceutical companies are not investing in this research because DCA method cannot be patented, without a patent they can't make money, like they are doing now with their AIDS Patent. Since the pharmaceutical companies won't develop this, the article says other independent laboratories should start producing this drug and do more research to confirm all the above findings and produce drugs.

By STEPHEN MATTHEWS FOR MAILONLINE 
PUBLISHED: 04:14 EST, 26 April 2017 | UPDATED: 23:18 EST, 26 April 2017
A mother-of-three has spoken of her terror after she almost lost her legs to a deadly infection which she caught from shaving her bikini line.
Dana Sedgewick, 44, from Sheffield, trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor but ended up cutting a spot on her groin.
Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from necrotising fasciitis - a flesh-eating infection.
Rushed to intensive care, doctors operated to remove as much of the rotting skin as they could - but she developed sepsis during the procedure.
She was placed in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times.
Having managed to survive the horrific ordeal, she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin - but doctors warned she would never walk again. 
But with the support of her husband, Mathew, 47, she has now recovered and can walk using crutches and is back at home with her children - Megan, 18, Freya, 14, and Klara, nine.
Mrs Sedgewick said: 'Like a lot of women, I tried to keep a tidy bikini line. So I had a quick trim with a new razor.
'But over the weekend, I felt unwell and noticed a little pimple on my groin which kept bleeding. I didn't think anything of it as I often got a rash from shaving.
'Little did I know that this tiny pimple would almost cost me my life.'
Mrs Sedgewick's ordeal began in May 2012. Two days after she'd shaved, she began experiencing dizziness and nausea.
She visited her GP, who took swabs of the area and prescribed her antibiotics to combat a suspected infection.
Later that day, her eldest daughter Megan discovered her lying in bed, with her legs covered in a bloody red rash.
Afterwards, her GP called to say that the swabs had revealed it was serious and that she needed to go in for another examination.
But when her husband dropped her off at the surgery, she collapsed.
An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the trauma unit at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, where doctors diagnosed her with necrotising fasciitis.
The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue, and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch.
Mrs Sedgewick said: 'By the time I got to the hospital, my legs were covered in black, rotting flesh. It was touch-and-go as to whether I'd make it.'
Over the next ten hours, surgeons battled to save her legs. Cutting through seven inches of infected skin, they removed the diseased flesh and reapplied skin from her back.
During surgery, she developed sepsis and was given a slim chance of survival after going into septic shock.
The 'silent killer' strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs. 
To increase her chances of survival, doctors decided to put her into an induced coma for nine days.
She said: 'When I woke up, my legs were covered in bandages and I had no idea what had happened. I thought I'd been in a car accident.
'But when the surgeon asked me if I remembered shaving, I suddenly recalled trimming my bikini line.
'He told me that the spot on my groin had become infected, and I'd been very lucky to survive.'
Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital's burns unit for specialist treatment, and was able to see her legs for the first time. 
She said: 'It was horrific. All of my muscle had rotted away, and I had a crater of skin near my groin. I felt like I was going to throw up.
'But I knew that it could have been much, much worse. I could easily have lost my legs - or worse, died.'
Doctors warned that she'd never walk again but she defied them and managed to walk on crutches, after intense physiotherapy.
Six weeks later, she was discharged from hospital.
Over the next four years, she underwent 21 operations to improve the appearance of her skin.
Mrs Sedgewick, who has been left with extensive scarring, said: 'It didn't feel like my own body any more.
'But with Mat's support, I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I'd been, and how lucky I was to survive.
'It's incredible to think a tiny shaving spot could have killed me. I had a very close shave indeed.'
Dr Ron Daniels BEM, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: 'Stories like Dana's illustrate the serious damage sepsis can do. Every day in the UK, individuals and families have their lives torn apart by the condition.
'But through better awareness, thousands of lives could be saved each year.
'While necrotising fasciitis is a rare cause of sepsis, it's crucial that members of the public and healthcare professionals consider it when presented with an unwell patient.
'Anyone with flu-like symptoms and one or more of the key signs of sepsis must call an ambulance immediately. With every hour that passes before the correct antibiotics are administered, the risk of death increases.'
WHAT IS NECROTISING FASCIITIS?
Necrotising fasciitis is most commonly caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus.
Those infections normally last just a few days - they are mild and typically clear themselves up.
But in some unusual cases it can develop into necrotising fasciitis.
They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, which are connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. 
The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. 
Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. 
When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death.",Narrative with Details </s> Narrative with details_details verified to be true </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> uppercase words </s> emotional appeals </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> fear </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified,true,"After shaving her legs, a woman developed a life-threatening skin infection that required the removal of massive amounts of skin and muscle tissue. </s> Mother-of-three, 44, develops deadly infection and nearly loses her legs after trimming her PUBIC HAIR with a brand new razor

179,﻿snes-06293,Baby Orajel can cause infants to stop breathing and turn blue.,"Dear all,I hope everyone is enjoying their summer. Some of you already know, but we wanted to make everyone aware of a terrifying experience that we had over the weekend. Thank g-d, everything’s ok now but we thought friends and family would want to be aware and would want to advise others with babies.
Zane’s been teething pretty badly for the past few days, and we decided to give him Baby Orajel on Sunday afternoon. We’ve given it to him a few times previously, when his first two teeth cut through, and never had a problem. Scott and I were both sitting with Zane on the floor in his room when I rubbed a dosage on his upper gum. Seconds after I gave it to him, he made a face as if he were crying but no noise came out. I picked Zane up and he immediately went limp in my arms and his face turned blueish. He was not panicking or gasping for air – he was lifeless. This lasted for approximately 15 seconds, but felt like an eternity. Words cannot convey our feelings during that time (or even now, ever) as we attempted to revive our son. No parent should ever experience such a feeling and no person should ever see something like this happen to a loved one. Without a doubt it was the scariest moment of our lives. Ultimately, Zane “came to” and began to cry hysterically. Thank g-d!!!!!!!!
We spent the evening at the hospital , where Zane underwent numerous tests, all of which came back normal. We also spoke with Zane’s pediatrician, who stated that she advises against the use of this product because its purpose is to numb and if it gets into an infant’s throat, it may stop them from breathing. Obviously, we wanted to learn more about this product and why this happened so we conducted some internet research. Interestingly, we came across some postings of parents with similar experiences. Further, one website listed a side effect as, “difficulty breathing and grey/blueish face.” Also, when we called Zane’s daycare to let them know what happened, the owner said that she’s heard of this happening before. It’s surprising then that no such warning is on the bottle and that more people do not discuss the negative and possible deadly implications of the use of this product.
We don’t want to imagine what could’ve happened if we had given this to him at night, in his crib, as we (and many others) have done in the past, and then walked away (although, of course we monitor him throughout the night).
To reiterate, the reason we share the above with you is to strongly advise you to throw away any Baby Orajel products you have at home and please advise your friends and family of the same. Trust us, it’s not worth the possible side effects.
Best,
Scott and Allison

Improve Your Hearing Naturally
July 5 2022
<b> Dear Friend -
What if I told you there are very effective all natural methods you can use at home to restore your lost hearing, safely, with no side effects? <b> 
How would you like to hear out of both ears equally, clearly and be able to understand every word other people are saying? <b> IF So... Then this might be the most important message you ever read. <b> 
Let Me Ask You This... 
<b> Do you blast the TV so loud it drives everyone else nuts? <b> Is hearing loss affecting your social life, your family, your career and maybe even your safety?
Will you be able to hear that intruder breaking into your house in the middle of the night? What about the smoke detector that did not wake you because you were sleeping on your good ear?
Is trying to function at social events almost impossible? Maybe conversations get drowned out by background noise and all you can do is pretend you are listening or constantly ask the person to repeat what they said. It may seem like everyone is mumbling. <b> It is very frustrating. <b> 
You're Never Too Old To Hear Better
Let me introduce myself. My name is Mike Tucker, I recently turned 50 and I was struck with sudden hearing loss, I lost most of my hearing in one ear and 10% in the other.
I had trouble hearing the TV, could not understand phone conversations and was constantly saying what.... It seemed like everyone was mumbling to me. I could hear people talking but not understand the words.
<b> I couldn't understand most conversations, music or TV. <b>  Conventions, seminars, meetings rooms, (all work related environments for me) were impossible to understand. I had more and more difficulties with just about everything. <b> I began to withdraw into my own world. <b> 
I was always asking people to repeat things, sometimes two and three times. Also for me, with only one ear, I was not able to tell where sound was coming from. When I heard a noise, I needed to look around the room to tell where it came from, or who was talking.
<b> I went through depression and withdrew from the few friends I had left. <b>  Family and relatives didn't want to talk to me on the phone because they knew I could not hear them well.
<b>Social situations became next to impossible <b> to function at so I avoided places where I knew I would not be able to hear anyways (talks, lectures, parties, bars). I made up excuses not to go out when invited.
Generally, any social situation with music was out. If I was going where there was going to be a lot of people (and a lot of background rumble), I found it was practically impossible to carry on a conversation.
I had developed many bad habits (pretending to hear, nodding & smiling, not being direct about my difficulty hearing, avoidance).
When my problem began I went to my G.P. who found nothing wrong and referred me to a ENT. From there I was put on antibiotics, to ""see"" if they helped. <b>Next I was loaded up with steroids (prednisone) and let me tell you I felt terrible. <b>
The side effects are horrible . I felt like a zombie. They did nothing for my hearing problem. Next I went to an audiologist and was told I had hearing loss (no kidding) I was given a list of hearing aids and was told to pick one out.
I could not afford the $4,000 for a hearing aid. Plus I knew other people that wore hearing aids. They were always complaining about the constant repairs, cleaning, adjustments, fittings and so on.... Not only could I not afford it I DIDN'T want one.
I was at an all time low in my life....
I was feeling really bad so I decided to flush out my system with herbs and other natural cleansing methods to get rid of the steroids and the wonderful side effects that they didn't tell me about.
<b>Then A Funny thing happened.... My hearing improved. <b> It wasn't a major improvement but I really did notice a difference. I knew there had to be a connection.
I started my own research on natural cures, herbs and supplements and how they related to hearing loss. I searched the Internet, the library and spoke to several herbologists. I looked at clinical trials and compiled all the information I could find.
I also made contacts in non U.S. countries where alternative medicines are widely accepted. The discoveries I made were pretty amazing. Armed with everything I learned I started treating myself.
My Hearing Began To Come Back!
It didn't happen overnight but.... I started noticing sounds I could not hear before! Now remember steroids, antibiotics and nothing else the doctors prescribed for me helped. 
Fast forward to today and I can engage in any conversation with no problem. In fact I annoy some people by calling them on the phone too much, something I totally avoided before.
The fact is most hearing loss sufferers can be helped. <u>You can improve your hearing <u>. Others have been helped from my findings and urged me to make my research available to everyone.
Of course this is not a miracle cure. If you have permanent damage to your ears or are completely deaf this book will not help you. I think most people will be able to tell if they can be helped or not.
The clinics and specialists do not tell you about these natural healing methods... there is just no money in it for them (at least that's my opinion), with over 34 million people suffering from hearing loss, hearing aid companies and physicians make millions of dollars per year.
The Truth About Hearing Loss
Damage to your inner ear from disease, blockage, noise or lack of nutrients will cause hearing loss. Poor blood flow, fluid from an infection and other factors can cause the tiny hair follicles in your inner ear to die.
The sad truth is most doctors will never know why your hearing went bad. In most cases they just can't explain it.
<b> Day by day the cells in your inner ear are dying, don't wait until your hearing is gone <u>forever.<u><b>
There are <u>natural herbs and supplements<u> you can take that can greatly improve and even restore your hearing. The tiny hair follicles in your inner ear can greatly improve with increased blood flow to them.
You may already know that free radicals have been show to cause disease. They are highly reactive molecules that disrupt the structure of normal cellular components like the ones in your inner ear.
One of the activities of free radicals is to destroy cochlear hair cells, which transmit acoustic information to the auditory nerve. <b> Using the <u> proper <u> antioxidant's you can fight off these free radicals. <b>","lack of citation for evidence </s> surface credibility markers - words associated with nature or healthiness </s> rhetorical tricks </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> lack of evidence or use unverified and incomplete evidence to make a claim </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> Using Anecdotes and Personal Experience as Evidence </s> surface credibility markers - medical or scientific jargon </s> bolded,  underline or italicized </s> uppercase words </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> financial motivation </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility",false,"Amish Cure for Hearing Loss </s> ""How To Restore Your Hearing Using Safe And Effective Natural Methods - That Doctors Don't Tell You About""

185,﻿tron-01810,23 Seniors Died After Receiving Flu Shots,"23 Seniors Died After Receiving Flu Shot Sold by Pharmacies
Package insert for Fluzone flu vaccine marketed to seniors reveals 23 seniors died during drug trial
Health Impact News Editor
The annual marketing campaign pushing people to receive flu vaccinations is in full force. CVS Pharmacies is offering a 20% off shopping pass if you purchase a flu vaccine.
[Image]
As you can see in the screen shot above, taken from the CVS website, senior citizens over the age of 65 are being targeted to get the ""high-dose"" flu vaccine.
The FAQ at the CVS website defines the ""high-dose"" flu vaccine: ""Containing four times the amount of antigen (the part of the vaccine that causes the body to produce antibody) in regular flu shots, high-dose flu shots, along with the additional antigen produced, are intended to create a stronger immune response.""
The name of this flu vaccine that is marketed for seniors is called ""Fluzone."" You can find it being marketed to seniors at all the major pharmacies in the United States.
Package inserts for flu vaccines show a multitude of side effects, including death, and yet they are marketed the same as over-the-counter drugs with no prescription needed. Why?
Because in the United States vaccines enjoy complete immunity from lawsuits in the market place. If you are injured or die from a vaccine, you or your family cannot sue the manufacturer of the vaccine. This law enacted by Congress, was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011.
Therefore, they are marketed with the same marketing techniques as any other high-profit product. With the baby boomer generation moving into their senior years, today's seniors are seen as an especially lucrative market.
So financial incentives like discounts on other products, as CVS is doing, is quite common in order to boost vaccine sales.
Walgreens has a different program that especially boosts sales of vaccines:
While vaccine rates in the U.S. among children are close to 90%, rates in other parts of the world (where pharmaceutical companies do not have immunity from the law for adverse effects) are much lower. So, in partnership with Walgreens, a non-profit organization (Shot@Life) buys up the vaccines and sends them to these countries for free (who doesn't want something for free, especially when you live in a poor country??)
This is a brilliant marketing plan for the pharmaceutical companies, as the U.S. government gives the organization buying the vaccines non-profit status, allowing them to receive tax deductible donations to pay for the vaccines. Walgreens is probably a contributor to the program as a tax write off.
With legal immunity to market dangerous products, don't expect those doing the marketing and making the profits to warn you of the side effects. You need to find this information yourself, usually from the Internet.
For those pro-vaccine forces that warn people how dangerous it is to get information from the Internet, the information we are about to share is directly from the FDA website (at least at the time of this writing - they have been known to remove items from their website if it gets too much publicity and makes them look bad), and you can look it up yourself.
The high-dose Fluzone vaccine being marketed this flu season to seniors, which has four times the amount of antigens that the regular flu shot has, as well as the non-high dose version, had 23 seniors die during drug trials.
The package insert for the high-dose Fluzone flu vaccine is found here (for now).
In the section documenting adverse effects, this is what is written:
""Within 6 months post-vaccination, 156 (6.1%) Fluzone High-Dose recipients and 93 (7.4%)  Fluzone recipients experienced a serious adverse event. No deaths were reported within 28 days post-vaccination. A total of 23 deaths were reported during the period Day 29-180 post-vaccination: (0.6%) among Fluzone High-Dose recipients and 7 (0.6%) among Fluzone 1 recipients. The majority of these participants had a medical history of cardiac, hepatic, neoplastic, renal, and/or respiratory diseases. No deaths were considered to be caused by vaccination.""
This statement stating that 23 seniors died, which really should be headline news but is buried in a package insert on the FDA website, begs several questions:
1. By what basis can they conclude that ""No deaths were considered to be caused by vaccination""??
2. If, as it is implied, the majority of these 23 deaths were caused by pre-existing conditions, why were there no deaths in the first 28 days? Shouldn't the deaths, if not attributable to the vaccine but pre-existing conditions, be equally spread out through all time periods?
3. How does the medical history for these 23 seniors compare to the medical history of those who did not die? Were there any significant differences? The range of symptoms given in the package insert can very well cover almost all seniors during the flu season. And what about those who died that were not among the ""majority"" who had these pre-existing conditions? A majority could simply be 12 out of the 23.
Besides death, which is just one ""serious adverse event,"" there were 226 other ""serious"" adverse events, for a total of 249 serious adverse events, out of only 3,833 participants.
If this does not constitute a dangerous drug that should probably not even be on the market, then I don't know what does. And yet, it is sold to unsuspecting seniors and others like candy at these drug stores.
One of these other adverse side effects (besides death) is Guillain-Barré syndrome, which has symptoms similar to polio. If you are brought into an emergency room with the paralyzing effects of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the first question the doctors will ask you is if you just received the flu shot. Read one story here of how one man went from being able to bench-press 275 pounds to struggling how to walk after receiving last year's flu shot: Miami Man Contracts Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Nearly Dies After Getting Flu Shot. Also, if you look at the majority of damages being paid out to those damaged from vaccines in the U.S. Vaccine Court, Guillain-Barré syndrome from the flu vaccine is #1, and almost equals all other awards for damages combined. (See: Flu Shot Causes Polio-like Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Are Rates Higher Than the Government Admits?)
The CDC would like you to believe that the risk of GBS from the flu shot is only one out of one million. But if that is the case, why is there a warning on package inserts of flu vaccines, and why is it the first question EMTs ask when dealing with GBS emergencies?
The package insert for Fluzone states: ""If Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has occurred within 6 weeks of previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give Fluzone High-Dose should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.""
I wonder how many vaccine sales people at these pharmacies give ""careful consideration"" to this adverse side effect, or any others, before injecting you?

Research Reveals E-Cigs Have 10 Times More Cancer Causing Ingredients Than Cigarettes
Eyfusing 
New research has found electronic cigarettes to contain even 10 times more cancer causing ingredients than the tobacco products they are supposed to save us from.
Quite an astonishing revelation given E-cigarettes are meant to replace a dangerous and life destroying habit.
E-cigarettes are used by millions of people worldwide, all with the belief that they are a safer alternative to tobacco products. However, according to research conducted by Japanese scientists, e-cigarettes contain 10 times the level of cancer-causing carcinogens than regular cigarettes.
In the research commissioned by the Japanese Ministry of Health, it was found that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde carcinogens are present, and prevalent, in the liquid produced by many e-cigarette products.
Furthermore, it was determined that e-cigarettes can fuel potentially life-threatening drug-resistant pathogens. This discovery comes from a lab study that tested the vapor from e-cigarettes on live methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and human cells.
According to a Japanese Ministry of Health official, the formaldehyde carcinogen is much more present in the e-cigarette liquids than in the chemicals used in regular cigarettes.
""In one brand of e-cigarette the team found more than 10 times the level of carcinogens contained in one regular cigarette. Especially when the wire (which vaporizes the liquid) gets overheated, higher amounts of those harmful substances seemed to be produced"", said researcher Naoki Kunugita.
Kunugita also added that the levels of the formaldehyde carcinogen varied in the final results.
""You call them e-cigarettes, but they are products totally different from regular tobacco. The government is now studying the possible risks associated with them, with view to looking at how they should be regulated.""
In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to underage people because they posed potentially serious health risks.
The UN health agency said that although there's a lack of evidence regarding the damage caused by e-cigarettes, there's still enough evidence ""to caution children and adolescents, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age"" about their use.
According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) more than a quarter of a million youth who had never smoked a cigarette used electronic cigarettes in 2013. This number reflects a three-fold increase, from about 79,000 in 2011, to more than 263,000 in 2013.

Original </s> Research Reveals E-Cigs Have 10 Times More Cancer Causing Ingredients Than Cigarettes
New research has found electronic cigarettes to contain even 10 times more cancer causing ingredients than the tobacco products they are supposed to save us from.
E-cigarettes are used by millions of people worldwide, all with the belief that they are a safer alternative to tobacco products.
However, according to research conducted by Japanese scientists, e-cigarettes contain 10 times the level of cancer-causing carcinogens than regular cigarettes.
In the research commissioned by the Japanese Ministry of Health, it was found that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde carcinogens are present, and prevalent, in the liquid produced by many e-cigarette products.
Furthermore, it was determined that e-cigarettes can fuel potentially life-threatening drug-resistant pathogens.
This discovery comes from a lab study that tested the vapor from e-cigarettes on live methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and human cells.
According to a Japanese Ministry of Health official, the formaldehyde carcinogen is much more present in the e-cigarette liquids than in the chemicals used in regular cigarettes.
""In one brand of e-cigarette the team found more than 10 times the level of carcinogens contained in one regular cigarette.
Especially when the wire (which vaporizes the liquid) gets overheated, higher amounts of those harmful substances seemed to be produced"", said researcher Naoki Kunugita.
Kunugita also added that the levels of the formaldehyde carcinogen varied in the final results.
""You call them e-cigarettes, but they are products totally different from regular tobacco.
The government is now studying the possible risks associated with them, with view to looking at how they should be regulated.""
In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to underage people because they posed potentially serious health risks.
The UN health agency said that although there's a lack of evidence regarding the damage caused by e-cigarettes, there's still enough evidence ""to caution children and adolescents, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age"" about their use.

Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .I think it's important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you're doing so with your eyes open.
RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE
Dear Editors
Recently I bought a cooking oil that's new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in ""bad"" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.
There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new ""wonder"" oil with all its low-fat health benefits. It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.
Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola. Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words ""Canada"" and ""oil"". Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants. According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, ""By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals"". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)
Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent. I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years. It works very well; it suffocates them. Ask for it at your nursery. Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines. It is an industrial oil. It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.
Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the ""Mad Cow disease"" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called ""scrapie"". It was thought this was how ""Mad Cow"" began and started to infiltrate the human chain. What is interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, 'scrapie' disappeared.
We also haven't seen any further reports of ""Mad Cow"" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same. US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies. The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use. They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but ""canola"" instead.
Except canola means ""Canadian oil""; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions. Look at the ingredients list on labels. Apparently peanut oil is being replaced with rape oil. You'll find it in an alarming number of processed foods. There's more, but to conclude: rape oil was the source of the chemical warfare agent mustard gas, which was banned after blistering the lungs and skins of hundred of thousands of soldiers and civilians during W.W.I. Recent French reports indicate that it was again in use during the Gulf War.
Check products for ingredients. If the label says, ""may contain the following"" and lists canola oil, you know it contains canola oil because it is the cheapest oil and the Canadian government subsidizes it to industries involved in food processing.
I don't know what you'll be cooking with tonight, but I'll be using olive oil and old-fashioned butter, from a genetically unmodified cow.
Here is more information....
Canola oil from the rape seed, referred to as the Canadian oil because Canada is mainly responsible for it being marketed in the USA. The Canadian government and industry paid our Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) $50 million dollars to have canola oil placed on the (GRAS) List, ""Generally Recognized As Safe"". Thus a new industry was created. Laws were enacted affecting international trade, commerce, and traditional diets. Studies with lab. animals were disastrous. Rats developed fatty degeneration of heart, kidney, adrenals, and thyroid gland. When canola oil was withdrawn from their diets, the deposits dissolved but scar tissue remained on all vital organs. No studies on humans were made before money was spent to promote Canola oil in the USA.
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare fatal degenerative disease caused by a build up long-chain fatty acids (c22 to c28) which destroys the myelin (protective sheath) of the nerves. Canola oil is a very long chain fatty acid oil (c22). Those who will defend canola oil say that the Chinese and Indians have used it for centuries with no effect, however it was in an unrefined form (taken from FATS THAT HEAL AND FATS THAT KILL by Udo Erasmus).
My cholesterol level was 150. After a year using Canola oil I tested 260. I switched back to pure olive oil and it has taken 5 years to get it down to 160. Thus began this project to find answers since most Doctors will say that Canola oil is O.K.
My sister spilled Canola oil on a piece of fabric, after 5 pre-treatings and harsh washings, the oil spot still showed. She stopped using Canola oil, wondering what it did to our insides if it could not be removed from cloth easily.
Our Father bred birds, always checking labels to insure there was no rape seed in their food. He said, ""The birds will eat it, but they do not live very long.""
A friend, who worked for only 9 mo. as a quality control taster at an apple-chip factory where Canola oil was used exclusively for frying, developed numerous health problems. These included loose teeth & gum disease; numb hands and feet; swollen arms and legs upon rising in the morning; extreme joint pain especially in hands, cloudy vision, constipation with stools like black marbles, hearing loss; skin tears from being bumped; lack of energy; hair loss and heart pains. It has been five years since she has worked there and still has some joint pain, gum disease, and numbness.
A fellow worker, about 30 years old, who ate very little product, had a routine check up and found that his blood vessels were like those of an 80 year old man. Two employees fed the waste product to baby calves and their hair fell out. After removing the fried apple chips from the diet their hair grew back in.
My daughter and her girls were telling jokes. Stephanie hit her mom's arm with the back of a butter knife in a gesture, ""Oh mom"" not hard enough to hurt. My daughters arm split open like it was rotten. She called me to ask what could have caused it. I said, ""I'll bet anything that you are using Canola oil"". Sure enough, there was a big gallon jug in the pantry.
Rape seed oil is a penetrating oil, to be used in light industry, not for human consumption. It contains a toxic substance. Even after the processing to reduce the erucic acid content, it is still a penetrating oil. We have found that it turns rancid very fast. Also it leaves a residual rancid odor on clothing.

Canola oil is a health hazard to use as a cooking oil or salad oil. It is not the healthy oil we thought it was. It is not fit for human consumption, do not eat canola oil, it can hurt you. Polyunsaturated or not, this is a bad oil.

Date:
June 15, 2020
Source:
Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences
Summary:
The less animal products someone consumes, the lower his body mass index on average and the less he tends to be extroverted. A connection with depressive moods as other studies had found could not be confirmed.

According to a survey by the Allensbach Institute, more than 6.1 million Germans stated last year that they were vegetarians, 400,000 more than two years earlier. A large-scale study at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in cooperation with the University Hospital of Leipzig has now examined in almost 9,000 people how this form of nutrition is related to the body and the psyche -- regardless of age, gender and level of education.
It was found that the rarer the proportion of animal food in a person's diet, the lower their body mass index (BMI) on average and thus their body weight. One reason for this could be the lower proportion of heavily processed foods in the plant diet. ""Products that are excessively rich in fat and sugar are particularly fattening. They stimulate the appetite and delay the feeling of satiety. If you avoid animal foods, you consume fewer such products on average,"" explains Evelyn Medawar, first author of the underlying publication, which has now been published in the journal Nutrients. In addition: Vegetarian food contains dietary fibres and has a positive effect on the microbiome in the intestine. This is another reason why they could fill you up earlier than those made from animal ingredients. ""People who eat predominantly vegetable foods may therefore absorb less energy,"" Medawar adds. In addition to a changed feeling of satiety, lifestyle factors such as more sport and greater health awareness could also play a decisive role.
For the BMI it also seems to make a difference which animal products a person feeds on. If it is predominantly so-called primary animal products, i.e. meat, sausage and fish, the person usually has a higher BMI than someone who eats primarily secondary animal products, i.e. eggs, milk, dairy products, cheese and butter. In the former case the correlation is statistically significant.
Medawar uses an example to illustrate what this could mean for nutrition: ""A person with a 1.2 point lower BMI on average either completely avoids certain animal products, such as the primary ones, and is on a vegetarian diet. Or she continues to eat meat and fish, but less often. Whether nutrition is ultimately the cause of lower body weight or whether other factors are responsible for it cannot be determined from the data. A follow-up study in cooperation with the University Hospital Leipzig will now shed light on this.
Nutrition and personality
The researchers also found out that vegetarian or vegan nutrition is also related to personality. Especially with one of the five major personality factors, extroversion. It was shown that people with predominantly plant-based foods on their diet are more introverted than those who mainly fed on animal products. ""It is difficult to say what the reason for this is,"" says Veronica Witte. ""It could be because more introverted people tend to have more restrictive eating habits or because they are more socially segregated because of their eating habits."" Here, again, further studies should follow on how people identify with the characteristics of their diet.
However, they could not confirm that a plant-based diet is associated with a tendency towards neurotic behaviour, as other studies suggested. ""Earlier analyses had found that more neurotic people were generally more likely to avoid certain groups of foods and to behave more restrictively. We focused here solely on the avoidance of animal products and could not observe any correlation,"" explains study leader Veronica Witte.
In a third part, they finally concentrated on the question of whether a predominantly plant-based diet is more often associated with depressive moods. Here previous studies had also suggested a relationship between the two factors. ""We could not detect this correlation,"" says Witte. ""It is possible that in previous analyses other factors had blurred the results, including the BMI or conspicuous personality traits that are known to be associated with depression. We accounted for them,"" said Witte explaining a possible reason for the different results. In addition, the plant-based diet is now more common and more accepted and not anymore restricted to a certain group.
The scientists had investigated these connections within the so-called LIFE project, a broad-based study in cooperation with the University Hospital of Leipzig. They determined the personal diets by means of questionnaires in which the participants were asked to fill in how often they had eaten the individual animal products in the last 12 months -- from ""several times a day"" to ""never."" The personality traits such as extroversion and neuroticism were assessed by means of a so-called personality inventory (NEOFFI), while depression was assessed by means of the so-called CESD test, a questionnaire that records various symptoms of depression.

Cannabis is having a truly hideous effect on some unlucky stoners in the US, where it has recently been legalized in some states.
Doctors said users have been taken to hospital after suffering extreme bouts of 'scromiting' - which means they are screaming and vomiting at the same time.
This new word was invented by staff at emergency rooms across the US, who are seeing more and more people turn up yelling in pain and throwing up all over the place.
Its believed the scromiting is caused by a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) which affects people who have consumed weed for a long period of time.
The illness is not properly understood, but it's known that the only guaranteed way to stop it is for sufferers to give up smoking cannabis altogether. Some people also get temporary relief by taking a hot bath.
Chalfonte LeNee Queen, a 47-year-old from San Diego, has experienced this grim condition.
She said the pain was sometimes so bad that she ended up on the floor, retching and wracked with pain.
'I've screamed out for death,' <a> she told NPR <a>.
'I've cried out for my mom, who's been dead for 20 years, mentally not realizing she can't come to me.'
The illness strikes users who have been smoking regularly for a long time, with one study suggesting people would need to <a> consume cannabis between three and fives time a day <a> to develop CHS.
'The syndrome was first described in 2004 by Allen and colleagues and is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and the learned behaviour of hot bathing,' doctors wrote.

192,﻿snes-01752,"New research has uncovered that the true cause of fibromyalgia is an excess number of specific nerves found near a specific kind of blood vessel in the hands and feet, ending the controversy over the diseases cause and mechanism","Fibromyalgia Mystery Finally Solved! Researchers Find Main Source of Pain in Blood Vessels
by Donna Ker Leesley,
Researchers Find Main Source of Pain in Blood Vessels.
Researchers have found the main source of pain in Fibromyalgia patients, and contrary to what many believe, it does not stem from the brain. The findings mark the end of a decades-old mystery about the disease, which many doctors believed was conjured in patients' imaginations. The mystery of Fibromyalgia has left millions of sufferers searching for hope in pain medications. Up until recently, many physicians thought that the disease was ""imaginary"" or psychological, but scientists have now revealed that the main source of pain stems from a most unlikely place- excess blood vessels in the hand, legs and foot.
The discovery may lead to new treatments and perhaps even a total cure in the future, bringing relief to as many as 5 million Americans thought to have the disease. To solve the Fibromyalgia mystery, researchers zeroed in on the skin from the hand of one patient who had a lack of the sensory nerve fibers, causing a reduced reaction to pain. They then took skin samples from the hands of Fibromyalgia patients and were surprised to find an extremely excessive amount of a particular type of nerve fiber called arteriole-venule (AV) shunts.
Up until this point scientists had thought that these fibers were only responsible for regulating blood flow, and did not play any role in pain sensation, but now they've discovered that there is a direct link between these nerves and the widespread body pain that Fibromyalgia sufferers feel.
 
The breakthrough also could solve the lingering question of why many sufferers have extremely painful hands and foot as well as other ""tender points"" throughout the body, and why cold weather seems to aggravate the symptoms. In addition to feeling widespread deep tissue pain, many Fibromyalgia patients also suffer from debilitating fatigue.
Neuroscientist Dr. Frank L. Rice explained: ""We previously thought that these nerve endings were only involved in regulating blood flow at a subconscious level, yet here we had evidences that the blood vessel endings could also contribute to our conscious sense of touch... and also pain,"" Rice said. ""This mismanaged blood flow could be the source of muscular pain and achiness, and the sense of fatigue which are thought to be due to a build-up of lactic acid and low levels of inflammation fibromyalgia patients. This, in turn, could contribute to the hyperactivity in the brain.""
Current treatments for the disease have not brought complete relief to the millions of sufferers. Therapies include narcotic pain medicines; anti-seizure drugs, anti-depressants and even simple advice such as ""get more sleep and exercise regularly."" Now that the cause of Fibromyalgia has been pinpointed, patients are looking forward to an eventual cure. Other expressed frustration about how much they had suffered already:
""When are they ever going to figure out that things are never ""all in your head?"" said one commenter. ""Whenever something doesn't fit in their tiny little understanding, they belittle the patient and tell them they are crazy. People have suffered through this since they were invented. Prescribing SSRIs for everything is not the answer any more than a lobotomy or hysterectomy was.""
The announcement has the potential to unlock better future treatments and undoubtedly has patients all over the world rejoicing that the mystery of Fibromyalgia has finally been solved.

Jean Hilliard was literally frozen stiff, ''like a piece of meat out of a deep freeze,'' when a friend found her in the snow after a night of 22-below-zero temperatures. But the 19-year-old has made an unusual recovery.
''At worst, I might lose a couple of toes,'' she says. ''I can't explain why she's alive,'' Dr. George Sather, who helped treat the young woman, said today. ''She was frozen stiff, literally. It's a miracle.''
Miss Hilliard was frozen after a midnight automobile accident in rural northwestern Minnesota.

Her face was ashen and her eyes were solid and did not respond to light. Thawing Out Process
''The reaction didn't appear until two or three hours after she started thawing out,'' Dr. Sather said. ''The body was cold, completely solid, just like a piece of meat out of a deep freeze.''

Clad in western boots, a coat and mittens, she began walking to Wally Nelson's home two miles away and collapsed only 15 feet from his door.
Mr. Nelson found her as walked out the door at 7 o'clock the next morning. Her body was so stiff that Mr. Nelson loaded her ''diagonally'' in the back seat of his car and headed for the hospital.
Doctors were unable to give her intravenous feedings because ''she was frozen too solid to penetrate the skin,'' said Dr. Sather's brother, Dr. Edgar Sather.
Her pulse, hardly registering through her frozen skin, was about 12 beats a minute. And her temperature was too low for a thermometer, with a low reading of 88 degrees, 10 degrees below normal.
