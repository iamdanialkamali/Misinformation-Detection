Michelle Shreeve
10/25/2016
Baby wipes are a necessity for parents, as they come in handy when you need a quick cleaner-upper. They're convenient to take on the go - not only for diaper messes, but also for sticky hands, faces, and even toys. Up to this point, we always assumed they were completely safe to use, until now...
Many parents wouldn't think twice about what's in their child's baby wipes. After all, they're completely safe to use - right?
More and more research is surfacing that baby wipes aren't the best thing for our children's skin. In fact, some doctors are recommending that parents cease using baby wipes on their children entirely, because of the risk they are taking each time they do so. 
According to NBC News, a study has surfaced that confirms baby wipes are not safe to use on your children due to one key ingredient. The results of the tests conducted were worrisome, as children ended up having a reaction that left them with itchy, scaly, and red-rashed looking skin.
An associate professor of dermatology and pediatrics at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Dr. Mary Wu Chang, was the co-author of this official study conducted. She experimented with many different children, and in the end, six unique reactions caught her attention.
One eight-year-old girl ended up having a severe rash on her buttocks and also around her mouth. Due to the location of where the reaction was located on the little girl's body, Dr. Chang narrowed the problem down to the baby wipes that were being provided to her. She asked the little girl's mother what exactly she was providing her daughter to clean with, and the mother confirmed she gives her baby wipes.
Remembering a previous report Dr. Chang stumbled upon during her research, another case where a Belgian man had a severe chemical and allergic reaction to a chemical preservative called methylisothiazolinone - Dr. Chang linked this preservative to the exact baby wipe reaction as the little girl.
To be sure, Dr. Chang tested the little girl to see if she was officially allergic to this particular chemical, and sure enough, her test came back positive. The solution was simple; the mother stopped using the baby wipes immediately, and all of the little girl's rashes successfully cleared up.
Over the next year and a half, Dr. Chang found similar reactions in five other kids. Thanks to the successful conclusion of the first little girl, Dr. Chang had the five sets of parents cease using baby wipes on their children, and their rashes went away as well.
Methylisothiazolinone has been found in many of the popular brands such as Johnson & Johnson, Cottonelle, and Huggies to name a few. Now that this chemical is becoming a health and safety concern for children, they are reconsidering adding this ingredient to their products. Their goal now it to try and replace this harmful chemical with a more natural alternative.
Another dermatologist, Dr. Ellen Frankel, also agrees with Dr. Chang that parents should not be using wipes on their children. She advised:
""I always tell parents do not under any circumstances use diaper wipes. They have a lot of chemicals in there, and can irritate skin that's already damaged sitting in urine, or feces, or sitting in a diaper that's just got an inclusive surface on it.""
To make sure this harmful chemical is not going to cause the same problems for your child, look at the ingredients on the side of the baby wipe box. If you see the chemical methylisothiazolinone, you may want to stop using those wipes and perhaps baby wipes altogether. This way you can prevent these severe rashes from happening to your child.

Although prepackaged wipes are the most convenient way to keep your children clean, the risk simply isn't worth it. Don't worry though, because there are other solutions such as creating your own DIY wipes at home with natural products, or simply using a cloth with warm water.","title of article as clickbait </s> surface credibility markers - words associated with nature or healthiness </s> rhetorical tricks </s> Highlighting Uncertainty and Risk </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> hope </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> Inappropriate Use of Scientific and Other Evidence - out of context_verified </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> fear </s> emotional appeals </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility",false,"Doctors are now warning parents to never use baby wipes because they contain a ""chemical"" called methylisothiazolinone. </s> In fact, some doctors are recommending that parents cease using baby wipes on their children entirely, because of the risk they are taking each time they do so.

3,﻿snes-02768,"Prolonged sexual arousal in men without an ejaculation can cause pain, a condition colloquially referred to as ""blue balls"".","Yes, Blue Balls Are A Real Thing And This Is Why Guys Get Them
Let's talk about blue balls. A lot of people seem to believe it's a myth, but this couldn't be further from the truth.
It's a real problem impacting countless men across the globe. At this very moment, there are at least two billion men with blue balls; it's an epidemic.
Just kidding. We actually have no idea how many men have blue balls right now. And now that we're really thinking about it, we don't want to know.
But there is a science behind why men get this uncomfortable feeling and why it's been labeled as such. Before we get into it, however, it might be helpful to define or describe blue balls for those unfamiliar with the term.
Blue balls is the painful and dull aching sensation a man gets in the testicular region following protracted sexual arousal without climax.
In other words, it's probably similar to how women feel after sex the vast majority of the time, only this disappointment is focused in one specific area.
Twitter users also offer helpful summaries of this topic:
When you feel like you have to sneeze but can't, it's like getting blue balls for your face — Matt Bueckert (@mattbueckert) March 4, 2015
just got blue balls from the new avengers trailer. — Chris Pizza Kitson (@ChrisKillUs) March 4, 2015
There is widespread debate over treatment for this pain, which includes everything from cold showers to manual stimulation and sleeping it off. Most agree that ejaculation is the only real solution to this issue.
Simply put, sexual healing is real in this sense. Marvin Gaye was on to something.
Even after orgasm, however, a man might find the pain hasn't fully dissipated. Don't worry, if you happen to experience this dreaded sensation, be comforted by knowing it will eventually subside one way or another.
Now let's explain why men sometimes experience this discomfort. It all has to do with what is known as epididymal hypertension, the medical term for blue balls.
In essence, when a man gets aroused, blood flows to the penis and scrotum, causing everything to become engorged. Pressure will continue to build up in this area until ejaculation.
Thus, if he remains aroused for an extended period of time, the pressure could lead to the pain we often refer to as blue balls.
Moreover, as Men's Health notes, it might even cause his testicles to turn a darker color, hence the colloquial name for the condition.
Indeed, this is a very real problem; science says so. But let's not forget about the ladies' suffering, too.
There is evidence only around 70 percent of women are able to orgasm during intercourse, according to a study from the Kinsey Institute.
Perhaps what all of this suggests is we need to pay more careful attention to the needs of our partners — mentally, physically and emotionally.
So there you have it. Blue balls are very much a real thing and now you know the science behind the condition.

Hi, My name is Lauren Archer, my son Kevin and I lived in Sugarland, TX. On October 2nd, 1994 I took my only son to McDonald's for his 3rd birthday.
After he finished lunch, I allowed him to play in the ball pit. When he started whining later on, I asked him what was wrong, he pointed to the back of his pull-up and simply said ""Mommy, it hurts."" But I couldn't find anything wrong with him at that time. I bathed him when we got home, and it was at that point when I found a welt on his left buttock. Upon investigating, it seemed as if there was something like a splinter under the welt. I made an appointment to have it taken out the next day, but soon he started vomiting and shaking, then his eyes rolled back into his head.
From there, we went to the emergency room. He died later that night. It turned out that the welt on his buttock was the tip of a hypodermic needle that had broken off inside. The autopsy revealed that Kevin had died from heroine overdose. The next week, the police removed the balls from the ball pit and lo and behold. There was rotten food, several hypodermic needles: some full; some used; knives, half-eaten candy, diapers, feces, and the stench of urine. If a child is not safe in a child's play area then where?

As I read the following, my heart sank.
In addition to the following true story, I will also add that my own sons were playing in the ball pit at Discovery Zone one day.
One son lost his watch, and was very upset.
We dug and dug in those balls, trying to find the watch.
I went to the manager and raised heck.
Came to find out, the ball pit is only cleaned out once a month.
My kids will never play in another ball pit.
Hi, My name is Lauren Archer, my son Kevin and I lived in Sugarland, TX.
On October 2nd, 1994 I took my only son to McDonald's for his 3rd birthday.
After he finished lunch, I allowed him to play in the ball pit.
When he started whining later on, I asked him what was wrong, he pointed to the back of his pull-up and simply said ""Mommy, it hurts."" But I couldn't find anything wrong with him at that time.
I bathed him when we got home, and it was at that point when I found a welt on his left buttock.
Upon investigating, it seemed as if there was something like a splinter under the welt.
I made an appointment to have it taken out the next day, but soon he started vomiting and shaking, then his eyes rolled back into his head.
From there, we went to the emergency room.
He died later that night.
It turned out that the welt on his buttock was the tip of a hypodermic needle that had broken off inside.
The autopsy revealed that Kevin had died from heroine overdose.
There was rotten food, several hypodermic needles: some full; some used; knives, half-eaten candy, diapers, feces, and the stench of urine.

Brownie Marie  03 June 2014 | 7:15 PM
A Veterans Affairs hospital in Michigan was told last month to cover up all Christian symbols inside of its chapel.
The Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center was found in non-compliance with a 2008 federal regulation that mandates that the house of worship be nonsectarian.
""The chapel must be maintained as religiously neutral, reflecting no particular faith tradition,"" the policy <a> states <a>.
Statues of Jesus and Mary, an altar, and a crucifix were encircled with a curtain at the Iron Mountain chapel after an inspection by the National Chaplain Center discovered the unauthorized items. The chapel's stained glass windows have not yet been replaced, and are also covered by a curtain.
Our Saviour's Lutheran Church pastor Richard Riley said the move is just one example of an anti-Christian movement taking place in the country.
""Christianity, not only globally, but particularly in the United States, is really under attack,"" he told <a> Fox News <a>.
""Christianity is coming under some horrendous conflict from the media and to some degree from our own government.""
Riley also said that having a Christian chapel is constitutionally protected.
""Christians have constitutional rights. We have a right to voice our opinion. Just because you are a Christian doesn't mean you lose your First Amendment rights,"" he insisted.
Rapid City Journal Black Hills Health Care System Director Stephen R. DiStasio said that the concealment of religious symbols does not detract from the purpose of the chapel.
""Their key purpose is to provide a designated space for a religious service at the request of the veteran and their family, a space for personal reflection and a space for community services,"" he said in a <a> statement <a>.

12,﻿snes-05953,A machine-shop worker tore his scrotum in a piece of machinery and then stapled it back together,"Scrotum Self-Repair
1991 Honorable Mention
Confirmed True by Darwin

One morning I was called to the emergency room by the head ER nurse. She directed me to a patient who had refused to describe his problem other then to say that he ""needed a doctor who took care of men's troubles."" The patient, about 40, was pale, febrile, and obviously uncomfortable, and had little to say as he gingerly opened his trousers to expose a bit of angry red and black-and-blue scrotal skin.
After I asked the nurse to leave us, the patient permitted me to remove his trousers, shorts, and two or three yards of foul-smelling, stained gauze wrapped about his scrotum, which was swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit and extremely tender. A jagged zig-zag laceration, oozing pus and blood, extended down the left scrotum.
Amid the matted hair, edematous skin, and various exudates, I saw some half-buried dark linear objects and asked the patient what they were. Several days earlier, he replied, he had injured himself in the machine shop where he worked, and had closed the laceration himself with a heavy-duty stapling gun. The dark objects were one-inch staples of the type used in putting up wallboard.
We x-rayed the patients scrotum to locate the staples; admitting him to the hospital; and gave him tetanus antitoxin, a broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, and hexachlorophene sitz baths prior to surgery the next morning.
The procedure consisted of exploration and debridement of the left side of the scrotal pouch. Eight rusty staples were retrieved, and the skin edges were trimmed and freshened. The left testis had been avulsed and was missing. The stump of the spermatic cord was recovered at the inguinal canal, debrided, and the vessels ligated properly, though not much of a hematoma was present. Through-and through Penrose drains were sutured loosely in site, and the skin was loosely closed.
Convalescence was uneventful, and before his release from the hospital less then a week later, the patient confided the rest of his story to me.
An unmarried loner, he usually didn't leave the machine shop at lunchtime with his co-workers. Finding himself alone, he had begun the regular practice of masturbating by holding his penis against the canvas drive-belt of a large floor-based piece of running machinery. One day, as he approached orgasm, he lost his concentration and leaned too close to the belt. When his scrotum suddenly became caught between the pulley-wheel and the drive-belt, he was thrown into the air and landed a few feet away. Unaware that he had lost his left testis, and perhaps too stunned to feel much pain, he stapled the wound closed and resumed work.
I can only assume he abandoned this method of self-gratification.

16,﻿tron-01360,Leftover Onions are Poisonous Because They're Magnets for Bacteria,"Breaking: America's Most Popular Cheese Recalled ... Immediately Throw It Spoiled Onions
Written by Zola Gorgon - author of several cookbooks.
Watch out for those spoiled onions...
I had the wonderful privilege of touring Mullins Food Products. Mullins is HUGE and is owned by 11 brothers and sisters in the Mullins family. My friend Jeanne is the CEO.
The facility is mammoth. We toured about 280,000 square feet! Questions about food poisoning came up and I wanted to share what I learned from a chemist.
The guy who gave us our tour is named Ed. He's one of the brothers. Ed is a chemistry expert and is involved in developing most of the sauce formula. He's even developed sauce formula for McDonald's.
Keep in mind that Ed is a food chemistry whiz. During the tour, someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise. People are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil. Ed's answer will surprise you. Ed said that all commercially-made Mayo is completely safe. ""It doesn't even have to be refrigerated. No harm in refrigerating it, but it's not really necessary."" He explained that the pH in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment. He then talked about the quint essential picnic, with the bowl of potato salad sitting on the table and how everyone blames the mayonnaise when someone gets sick.
Ed says that when food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the 'victim' last ate ONIONS and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?). Ed says it's not the mayonnaise (as long as it's not homemade Mayo) that spoils in the outdoors. It's probably the onions, and if not the onions, it's the POTATOES. He explained, onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions. You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion. He says it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator. It's already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!)
Ed says if you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you'll probably be okay, but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich, you're asking for trouble. Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down.
So, how's that for news? Take it for what you will. I (the author) am going to be very careful about my onions from now on. For some reason, I see a lot of credibility coming from a chemist and a company, that produces millions of pounds of mayonnaise every year.'
Also, dogs should NEVER eat onions. Their stomachs cannot metabolize onions.","title of article as clickbait </s> Using Anecdotes and Personal Experience as Evidence </s> anxiety </s> uppercase words </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> emotional appeals </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility",false,"Leftover Onions are Poisonous Because They're Magnets for Bacteria </s> Immediately Throw It Spoiled Onions

18,﻿snes-02028,"In July 2017, it was announced that Finnish researchers would begin human trials of a Type 1 diabetes vaccine in 2018","Finnish diabetes vaccine trials to start in 2018
Finnish researchers have developed an experimental vaccine against type 1 diabetes, and tested it successfully on mice. Type 1 diabetes may be more common in Finland than anywhere else in the world.
An enterovirus, which likely causes type 1 diabetes. Image: Lääketieteen ja biotieteiden tiedekunta / Tampereen yliopisto
19.7.2017•Updated 19.7.2017
A vaccine for type 1 diabetes developed by Finnish researchers will be tested on mainly Finnish human subjects in late 2018, researchers announced on Tuesday.
The scientists first found that the prototype works effectively and safely on mice, and now say
that the vaccine could be in mainstream use within eight years if the coming rounds of tests prove successful.
The vaccine will first be given to a group of 30 healthy men during the first phase of the clinical trials, followed by a group of some 150 children if all goes well. After two successful rounds the vaccine can be considered safe and effective against viruses. The final round of vaccinations, intended for a group of some 4,000 children, should tell researchers whether the vaccine specifically prevents type 1 diabetes.
Virus likely culprit
A virus may be behind a significant proportion of type 1 diabetes cases, which are especially common among children. Professor Heikki Hyöty from the University of Tampere and Professor Mikael Knip of the University of Helsinki have worked on the pathology of diabetes from more than 20 years, and say they are confident that an enterovirus that attacks the pancreas to destroy insulin-producing cells is the root cause of type 1 diabetes.
The insulin-producing cells marked in green are destroyed by diabetes. Image: Lääketieteen ja biotieteiden tiedekunta / Tampereen ylipopisto
If the vaccine proves effective in humans, it could do much to minimise suffering as well as expenses.
""It is estimated that the additional cost of care for one child with diabetes over their lifetime is about a million euros,"" Knip says. ""This vaccine could prevent at least half of new cases, which amounts to some 250 million euros in annual savings.""
Enteroviruses are the most common type of infectious virus in humans; they cause a wide variety of health problems from the flu and eye infections to meningitis and heart inflammation.
Humanity last beat back an enterovirus via vaccination when polio was all but eradicated in the late 1980s.
US funding, biotech co-op
The team of researchers sought funding for their vaccine trial for four years, with no European benefactors stepping up.
Eventually American biopharmaceutical company Provention Bio agreed to fund the trial in full. The company has raised just under 25 million euros, most of which will go towards seeing the vaccination trials through. Investors include companies, individuals and funds.
Professors Hyöty and Knip founded a company of their own, Vactech, in 2001. They are part-owners of the firm, which has given Provention Bio the green light to use and manage their enterovirus vaccine. Vactech owns shares in Provention Bio.
""The only way to change years of university study into a working vaccine is through business cooperation,"" says Hyöty. ""Human trials are so expensive that only a large enough international company with enough room for risk management to be prepared in case the vaccine is found wanting.""
Finland suffers highest rate of type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes may be more common in Finland than anywhere else in the world. Some 500-600 children contract it each year, which is also the largest relative figure worldwide.
The number of type 1 diabetes sufferers has multiplied by six since the 1950s. It is only in the recent decade that incidence growth has plateaued. There are some 45,000 people in Finland who suffer from type 1 diabetes, and nearly half a million people who carry some form of diabetes.

Nature provides many sources of medicine, some of which are so common that we overlook their value. Onion is one such source of healing and the many benefits of onions for health and beauty are now being understood for the first time. It's not really surprising - just the odor of frying onions is a clarion call to the hungry!
Origins of Onions - 7,000 years of the benefits of onions
Onions have been  been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years as a food source.  In <a> Bronze Age <a> settlements, traces of onion remains were found alongside date stones and fig remains that date back to 5000 BC. We find evidence of the use of onions in the bible in the  Book of Numbers and the workers who built the Egyptian pyramids were fed onions as an integral part of their diet.

Amongst the other benefits of onions, the juice of onions has been used as a moth repellent and can be rubbed on the skin to prevent insect bites. When applied to the scalp,onion juice  is said to promote growth of hair. Onion juice has also  been used to polish glass and copper!
The article and video below focus on the many health benefits of onions and give  fascinating insights to some of its unusual properties. So next time you handle an onion in your kitchen - have a little respect and think for a moment about what a miracle this little vegetable really  is!
Benefits of Onions: Natural Healing 
Onions may bring tears to your eyes but the momentary pain they cause is easily outweighed by the fact that they can also help fight  diseases. The bulbous vegetables are grown all over the globe and used in may different ways. They can be eaten alone, added to dishes to increase the flavor, used to clean barbecue grills, and even placed in ears or socks at night to help heal our bodies. You read that last part correct; onions can help fight colds, fevers, and flu-like symptoms.
Benefits of Onions:  Earache
If you ever have a painful earache try this age old self-healing trick. Grab an onion, cut it open, and take out the central-most portion of it. Place the onion heart in the opening of your ear before you go to sleep and when you wake up you should feel much better. The onion will soften any built up ear wax and make it easier to remove. It also works overnight to naturally and effectively decrease any inflammation in the ear that is causing you pain.
Benefits of Onions: For Your Feet
The practice of placing onions on people's feet can be traced back to ancient Chinese medicine. The Chinese determined that there are thousands of nerve endings on the bottom of feet which act like access points to internal organs and are closely linked with our nervous systems. When a cut onion is placed on the underside of the foot it kills germs and bacteria because onions naturally have strong anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties.
Phosphoric acid, the stuff that's responsible for making you cry, enters into the bloodstream and helps purify the blood all over your body. In turn, you become healthier and your improved body is better prepared in terms of its ability to fight off infections and inflammation.
How to use onions for your feet
Here's how to do it: Take an onion, red or white both work, and cut it into flat slices so they can be easily applied to the bottom of your feet. Pull on a pair of socks over the onions to keep them in place overnight, lay back, sleep, wake up, remove the socks, and discard the onions. It's that simple. As you dream the onion will seep into and through your skin where it works to purify blood and absorb toxins.

26,﻿snes-04217,Products from Pepsi and other major food producers are 'manufactured using the tissue of aborted human babies.',"Actual content - 
Sickening: Major food corporations use tissue from aborted babies to manufacture flavor additives in processed foods
Wednesday, April 15, 2015 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer
Tags: aborted babies, flavor chemicals, food corporations
NaturalNews) Every time you purchase mass-produced processed ""food"" from the likes of Kraft, PepsiCo, or Nestle, you're choosing, whether you realize it or not, to feed your family not only genetically engineered poisons and chemical additives, but also various flavoring agents manufactured using the tissue of aborted human babies.

It's true: A company based out of California, known as Senomyx, is in the business of using aborted embryonic cells to test fake flavoring chemicals, both savory and sweet, which are then added to things like soft drinks, candy and cookies. And Senomyx has admittedly partnered with a number of major food manufacturers to lace its cannibalistic additives into all sorts of factory foods scarfed down by millions of American consumers every single day.

Known as ""HEK-293,"" the aborted human fetal cell line used by Senomyx is manipulated to evaluate how the human palate will react to synthetic flavors used in the production of processed foods. Since most processed foods on the market today are hardly food to begin with, and typically lack any real flavor or appeal on their own, chemical companies like Senomyx are hired to develop artificial ones (<a> which are often deceptively labeled as ""natural flavors"" <a> ) in order to make them taste like real food.

But because these ingredients can be legally disguised with vague descriptors like ""artificial flavors"" and even ""natural flavors,"" most consumers have no idea that these additives, in some cases, are actually made using the cell tissue of unborn babies that were murdered through abortion. It's sickening but true, and people must learn the truth in order to avoid partaking in what EndAllDisease.com says amounts to a satanic ritual.

""What they don't tell the public is that they are using HEK 293 -- human embryonic kidney cells taken from an electively aborted baby to produce those receptors,"" Debi Vinnedge of the pro-life group Children of God for Life said about the ugly truth of the flavoring chemical industry. ""They could have easily chosen animal, insect, or other morally obtained human cells expressing the G protein for taste receptors.""


Vaccines, ""beauty products"" loaded with chemicals made from unborn babies murdered via legalized genocide
Processed food isn't the only hidden source of additives made using aborted human fetal tissue -- many so-called ""beauty products"" and vaccines are also loaded with aborted baby tissue-derived additives. According to EndAllDisease.com, Neocutis ""beauty"" products and anti-wrinkle creams are made from aborted male baby cells collected after a 14-week gestation period.

Many vaccines, including Merck & Co.'s MMR II vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, as well as ProQuad (Merck), Varivax (Merck), Pentacel (Sanofi Pasteur) and Havrix (GlaxoSmithKline), also contain derivatives of aborted human babies.

The following list outlines processed ""<a> food <a>"" products, vaccines and ""beauty products"" known to contain ingredients derived from aborted human babies (and there are likely many more; your best bet is to avoid all processed foods in general):

27,﻿snes-01260,Exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke will get you high and potentially show up in a drug test.,"Secondhand Pot Smoke Can Make You Fail a Drug Test
People who are exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke may feel a bit of the ""high"" that comes with using the drug, a new study finds. They may also feel unable to think clearly, and they may even have detectable levels of the drug in their urine or blood. But all of this happens only if they are exposed to marijuana smoke under severely unventilated conditions, the study found.
""If you're going to breathe in enough passive cannabis smoke to feel high and potentially be slightly impaired, you could fail a drug test,"" said Evan S. Herrmann, the study's lead author and postdoctoral fellow in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. ""But this only happens under a very extreme situation.""
Cannabis is the world's most commonly used illicit drug. It is often smoked in small, enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, according to the study.
Studies in the 1980s showed that such ""social exposure"" to pot smoke could trigger positive drug tests for cannabis' main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). But such studies had several limitations. They used marijuana that had much lower potency than the pot available today and they failed to account for normal levels of ventilation in rooms. They also did not examine how people may feel or behave after such exposures.
""This new study probes a question people have been wondering forever,"" said Ziva Cooper, an assistant professor of clinical neurobiology at Columbia University, who was not involved in this research. ""Do people actually get high from these 'hot box' effects? And if so, does it change your capabilities or cause you to fail a drug test?""
In the first study of its kind, Herrmann's team recruited about 20 healthy people between the ages of 18 and 45, including some who smoked marijuana and some who didn't use the drug. The researchers tested the participants' blood, saliva, urine and hair samples for cannabis biomarkers, and then asked six smokers and six nonsmokers to relax in a Plexiglas and aluminum smoke chamber about the size of a dorm room. Participants underwent two separate sessions, each an hour long.
The researchers gave each of the six smokers 10 marijuana cigarettes, each containing 1 gram of high-potency weed, and instructed them to smoke at their leisure for the hour while the six non-smokers sat by their side in the chamber.
During one test session, the room's ventilation system was switched on, allowing air to flow in and out at a standard office-building rate. In the other session, the researchers restricted the airflow in the chamber. After the 60 minutes, each participant completed a series of biological, cognitive and subjective surveys and tasks at regular intervals for up to 34 hours after exposure. [11 Odd Facts About Marijuana]
""Our results are pretty consistent with what we expected,"" Herrmann said. The new findings confirm ""it's really hard to get a positive [drug test result] from passive smoke unless you're in an extreme scenario,"" he said.
Under the unventilated, ""hot box"" condition, the nonsmokers showed slight impairments on cognitive tests, reported feeling high, and had detectable levels of THC in their blood and urine for up to 22 hours post-exposure. Those in the ventilated condition had much lower levels of THC in their blood, did not feel impaired or high, and did not test positive for THC in their urine.
But the unventilated room is not representative of most real-life situations, the researchers said. ""We modeled the worst-case scenario,"" Herrmann said. ""You are in an enclosed room for an hour with 15 grams of cannabis being smoked.""
Ideally, the study would have had a placebo group, in which nonsmokers were exposed to smoke without THC. This would have helped the researchers determine whether the feeling of being high was due to the marijuana or simply a placebo effect, from being exposed to smoke.
Still, ""this study is really important because it adds to our limited knowledge of the direct effects of cannabis smoking and the potential dangers of second-hand smoke,"" Cooper said.",Establishing Legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible,true,"Exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke will get you high and potentially show up in a drug test. </s> People who are exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke may feel a bit of the ""high"" that comes with using the drug, a new study finds.

By Michael Dhar published December 19, 2013
Jell-O is made of gelatin, sweetener, and artificial flavorings.
Jell-O is a sweetened gelatin product made by boiling the bones and hides of animals. (Image credit: Shutterstock)
It's brightly-colored, jiggly and a mainstay of dinner tables and frat parties everywhere in America. It's Jell-O, a dessert that's been sold since 1897 . 
But anyone whose chewed on that weirdly squishy confection has wondered: what exactly is Jell-O? And why does it have that distinctive texture?                 
Technically, ""Jell-O"" is actually a brand name, currently owned by Kraft Heinz, that is used to market a range of desserts and snacks. But most people use the term to refer to the gelatin-based desserts that are also sold under the ""Jell-O"" name. The jiggly red dessert we think of as Jell-O is made up of almost 90% sugar, although the key ingredient that gives Jell-O its distinctive consistency is gelatin.  (The dessert also contains artificial colors, sweeteners and other flavorings, such as strawberry, orange and lime.)
Gelatin itself is a collection of long, stringy animal-based proteins called collagen, which bond together in three-stranded helical structures - similar to the two-stranded helices of DNA. It is created by cooking that collagen, according to Healthline(opens in new tab). 

Urban legends claim that gelatin comes from horse or cow hooves, though that's not the case. The collagen in gelatin does come from boiling the bones and hides of animals processed for their meat (usually cows and pigs(opens in new tab)). But hooves consist of a different protein, keratin(opens in new tab), which can't produce gelatin.
To make Jell-O, you need to heat the gelatin in water. Heating breaks the bonds holding the collagen together. Next, the heated water-gelatin solution must be cooled, allowing the collagen strands to rebond in a network, but if it's cooled with the right timing, water molecules will get trapped inside this collagen-network, Scientific American reported(opens in new tab). The collagen network gives Jell-O its semisolid properties, while the trapped water keeps it jiggly.

29,﻿snes-03646,"Tequila fights viruses, aids weight loss, and is beneficial for people afflicted with gastrointestinal illness.","It's national tequila day, but did you know that tequila has some surprising health benefits. Here are 6 interesting facts and benefits of tequila; we're talking about quality tequila, not that cheap stuff from the corner shop. Remember to drink responsibly and within your recommended weekly units.
1. <b> Tequila can help you lose weight <b> 
Tequila has a particular kind of sugar in it called agavins, which posses some weight-loss properties. The special molecular structure of agavins doesn't raise the blood sugar, meaning that many of the calories pass through the system unused, unlike other alcohol sugars, helping dissolve fats and stimulate the metabolism.
2. <b>  Helps with Digestion <b>
Because Teuila helps stimulate your metabolism, it helps with your digestion. Many communities have a shot of tequila before or after a meal to soothe and assist digestion.
3. <b> Tequila is a Probiotic <b>
Probiotics are healthy bacteria that are naturally occurring in the intestines. Responsible for our immune system and keeping a healthy balance in our bodies. Fructans, from which tequila is derived from, can help these good bacteria flourish. If you get drunk off tequila it will most likely have the opposite effect, but a small amount could help.
4. <b>  Tequila may help fight osteoporosis <b>
Agavins in tequila has been linked in several studies that help aid the body absorb calcium, which can be an option for preventing fragile or brittle bones.
5. <b>  Tequila may lower the chances of Dementia <b>
In this BBC report, they state that studies show a link between moderate alcohol drinkers and lower incidence of dementia later in life. The study also showed a correlation between people drinking too much alcohol and having a higher chance of dementia onset.
6. <b>  It doesn't give you a hangover. <b>
The decent, 100% agave tequila won't give you a hangover, whereas the cheaper brands will be full of other sugars that will most likely give you a hangover.

30,﻿tron-01427,McDonalds Busted for Human Meat Fillers,"China’s tainted meat scandal explained
Zoe Li, CNN
Updated 3:12 AM EDT, Wed July 30, 2014
CNN — 
McDonald’s restaurants in many Chinese cities have been eerily quiet this past week.
The fast food giant is enormously popular in China where it has 2,000 outlets, each one typically overflowing with hungry crowds.
But many McDonald’s addicts have been forced to go cold turkey as numerous branches have yanked flagship burgers off the menu amid a tainted meat scandal.
The food scare broke when a video surfaced in Chinese media last week, showing appalling practices in a Shanghai food-processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands.
Since then, the tainted meat supply has been found to reach across China, all the way to Hong Kong, and even to Japan.

How was the scandal uncovered?
A reporter from a Shanghai broadcaster secretly filmed inside the food processing plant of Shanghai Husi Food, a subsidiary of U.S.-based food supply giant OSI Group.
The footage captured workers handling food with their bare hands. Several scenes showed them picking up meat that had fallen on the floor and returning it directly into the processing machine.
One worker, his face concealed behind a surgical mask, turned to the camera and stated, “foul meat,” referring to the meat being handled.
Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) subsequently investigated the factory and found that expired beef and chicken products were processed and repackaged with new expiration dates.
Amongst the tainted products, they were able to trace forged production dates on more than 4,300 cases of smoked beef patties, with more than 3,000 cases already sold.
Who was affected?
Husi had been supplying chicken and beef products to branches of McDonald’s, Papa John’s, Burger King, Starbucks, KFC, and Pizza Hut in several cities in China.
READ: China scare snares Burger King, Papa John’s
Since the scandal broke, all the brands have cut ties with Husi’s parent company OSI Group, except for McDonald’s.
The golden arches will continue to work with the food supplier in China, eventually shifting to a Husi food plant in Henan province, which was described as the “newest state-of-the-art facility” by OSI CEO Sheldon Lavin.
McDonald’s has worked with OSI for more than half a century internationally, and for more than 22 years in mainland China, a spokesperson surnamed Xu told CNN.
Meanwhile, beef and chicken products at most McDonald’s in northern and central China are unavailable. Branches in southern China, which use a different meat supplier, are largely unaffected.
Xu also said the products will slowly return to menus after August 3.
In Hong Kong, McDonald’s previously stated that it does not use products from Husi. It later backtracked the claim after local government issued a ban on the import and sales of Husi products.
As a result of the ban, chicken nuggets, chicken filets, as well as several vegetable products and iced lemon tea are now temporarily unavailable at the city’s McDonald’s branches.
Japan’s McDonald’s have also been affected as 20% of the meat for chicken nuggets there were supplied by Husi. It has since stopped importing chicken from China and introduced a tofu and fish version of the McNugget.
The scandal has led to “negative impact on sales and consumer confidence,” the company’s Japanese unit said in a statement. “Our sales and profit expectations have been reduced.”

Who was held responsible?
Although no one has fallen sick as a direct result of the tainted meat supply, Shanghai’s FDA has closed the Husi plant at the center of the scandal, and detained five employees for questioning.
Meanwhile, Shanghai’s top official has pledged to mete out “severe punishment” for anyone involved in the incident, China Daily reported.
OSI Group is conducting its own internal investigation, promising “swift and decisive action” against those responsible.
It has also announced a number of organizational changes that it says will better ensure food safety at its China subsidiaries. This includes taking the previously separate and decentralized China operations and shifting them under the global management umbrella.
It will also launch an Asia Quality Control Center in Shanghai and a three-year, RMB 10 million ($1.6 million) food safety campaign.
Is China doing enough for food safety?
Food safety has long been a top concern for China, affecting domestic and foreign companies.
In 2008, a major scandal erupted over tainted infant formula that killed several babies and left thousands more ill.
Earlier this year, Wal-Mart recalled donkey meat after it was found to be contaminated with fox meat.
Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, has just emerged from a food safety scandal that began in late 2012.
The latest Husi scandal comes amid a revision of China’s food safety laws.
Earlier this month, the National People’s Congress released a draft version of the law on its website, seeking public opinion. It promised harsher punishment for offenders.
“Over past years, punishment for food safety violators has been increased but it still lags far behind that in developed countries. There should be much higher punishment for offenders,” an anonymous industry insider told China Daily.",Narrative with Details </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> Narrative with details_details not verified </s> Inappropriate Use of Scientific and Other Evidence - out of context_verified </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified,false,"McDonalds Busted for Human Meat Fillers </s> But many McDonald’s addicts have been forced to go cold turkey as numerous branches have yanked flagship burgers off the menu amid a tainted meat scandal.

June 29, 2018
Bonnie Annis
There are many signs and symptoms of breast cancer, although some of them aren't very well known. Early detection can help prevent more serious problems. Learn more about how to recognize and protect yourself.
Breast cancer. What do you think of first when you hear those words? Do you immediately think of death? Does your mind instantly conjure up pictures of bald, gaunt women in the midst of chemotherapy treatment? Or do you see yourself in the mirror wondering if you might possibly be the next person to receive a diagnosis? You may not have pictured any of these scenarios; instead, you may have immediately thought about the discovery of a palpable lump in breast tissue. And while breast lumps are very common warning signs of possible cancer, they are not the only ones.
There are several less-known warning signs of a possibility of breast disease. In this post, my desire is to bring awareness to lesser-known symptoms in hopes of helping save someone's life. When it comes to breast cancer awareness, knowledge is power and the more we know, the better prepared we can be for the future.
Before we begin talking about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, may I ask you a question? How well do you know your breasts? That's an embarrassing question for some, but it's an important one. Do you ever take time to really look at your breasts? If you haven't scrutinized them before, it's time you do.
When you have the opportunity, stand in front of a large mirror. Remove your blouse and bra. Look at yourself from the neck down. As you view your chest area, look at the size of your breasts. They may or may not be symmetrical and that's OK. Many women are born with one breast slightly larger or smaller than the other. The important thing is to really pay attention to how your breasts look.
While viewing your breasts, look at them in a scientific manner. Do you notice any immediate areas of concern? If so, make a mental note of the area. You may even want to take a digital picture. Next, turn your body to the side. View your breasts individually from each side. Once again, look for any areas of concern. After completing the visual inspection of your breasts, now would be a good time to do a breast self-exam. If you've never done one before, they are fairly easy to do. Here are step by step instructions.
Now, let's discuss the less common signs that could indicate a possibility of breast cancer. One of the first and most commonly overlooked signs is a slight puckering of the breast. The puckering may be very slight. It might not be visible unless you lift your arms and look at your breasts in the mirror with arms raised. If you notice any puckering, no matter how slight, you need to see your doctor and have this area checked. The puckering may be near the nipple, along the sides of your breasts, or anywhere along your breast tissue. As a tumor in the breast begins to grow, it can sometimes disrupt the architecture of the skin and cause a pulling of tissues and ligaments. Puckering may be so slight it only looks like a mild indentation and it may resolve after you've moved your arms back into a normal position.
Along with puckering, another possible sign of breast cancer is breast dimpling. Dimpling is a type of condition that resembles the skin of an orange. There may be slight pitting or dimples along the breast tissue. If you notice any such areas, please have them checked as soon as possible.
Another less common sign of possible breast cancer involves the nipple. This symptom is more noticeable and more commonly shared with a medical professional. This sign involves discharge. Any discharge that comes from the nipple on its own should be reported to a doctor, especially if it is tinged with blood. Nipple discharges that come from the nipple upon squeezing, do not usually indicate breast cancer. In fact, a slightly cloudy fluid may be normal colostrum in women who are pregnant or about to begin nursing.
Changes in the color of the nipple or areola should also be reported to your doctor. Sometimes a flaking or irritation of the nipple can signal a problem. If your nipple has changed in appearance, pay particular attention. Breast cancer can invade nipple tissue causing variations in texture, appearance, or color. An inverting (turning inward) of the nipple could also signal a problem.
Another less known sign of breast cancer can be breast pain. If you notice a particular area of your breast that hurts, like a deep, inner throbbing, have your doctor evaluate it as soon as possible. A growing tumor can cause breast tissue pain.
Red spots on the skin of the breast can also be warning signs of a problem. Although this sign is often disregarded, it can be a very subtle warning signal of a very dangerous type of breast cancer. Red areas on the breast tissue can warn of inflammatory breast cancer. This type of cancer is rare, but needs to be evaluated quickly. If your breast becomes warm, red, swollen, or if you notice your breast tissues has thickened, please get checked. You may only have a type of breast infection but it's always better to be safe than sorry.
Now that you know some of the lesser known symptoms of breast cancer, please be sure and check your breasts on a regular basis. Perhaps you'd like to put a reminder in your phone calendar or find some other way to help you remember to check yourself. There are even websites you can sign up for that will send you free reminders, Check Your Boobies is one such organization. Along with these symptoms, please remember, in your exams, to pay particular attention to any lumps, masses or areas of hard tissue you come across. Also, make sure to have regular mammograms or other diagnostic tests. While these tests are vitally important, the majority of breast cancers are found by women who are diligent to check their bodies. It's our responsibility to do what we can to protect ourselves.
In the event you notice any of the symptoms described in this article, don't instantly become fearful and assume you have breast cancer but do see a doctor as soon as possible. Early detection can often prevent more serious problems later.",legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> anxiety </s> emotional appeals </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> fear,true,"Warning About Inflammatory Breast Cancer </s> Lesser-Known Symptoms of Breast Cancer

34,﻿snes-04138,The FDA said Frosted Flakes are healthier than avocados,"According To The FDA, Frosted Flakes Are ""Healthier"" Than Avocados

ByBrianna Acuesta
The FDA has admitted that their rudimentary definition of the word ""healthy"" is outdated.
Credit: Wall Street Journal
The Food and Drug Administration is an organization whose motives and influences have long been questioned by American citizens. Many speculate that the organization has been bribed by Big Food companies who want a hold on what the FDA deems as healthy so that adults and children can be misguided about what to eat.
Based on a rudimentary system of saying that any food that's low in fat, sodium, and cholesterol, as well as full of some ""beneficial nutrients,"" many processed foods are healthier than wholesome produce in the eyes of the FDA.
The FDA also doesn't have a caveat that states that foods high in unsaturated fat (the healthy kind found in avocados, for example) are better than foods low in saturated fat.
This poses a problem, as the source of the fat and other components that make up food products and whether they were formed naturally is important and critical to the health of the person consuming it.
In a widely-circulated example of the absurdity of this logic, the FDA essentially says that Frosted Flakes, which are loaded with sugar and have minimal nutrients, are healthier than avocados.
Though the laws governing what is healthy have been long-standing, the outrage over them increased recently when the FDA wrote a 3,200 word letter to Kind snack food company, attacking them for calling their bars ""healthy.""
The organization demanded that Kind stop calling their bars healthy, even though the bars are full of antioxidants and essential fatty acids, and instead the FDA received backlash from angry citizens who actually know what ""healthy"" means.
In the heat of the backlash, the FDA admitted that their definition of what is good to consume was outdated and agreed to redefine the term. Though this is promising, it's likely that their new definition will be equally as vague as the last in order to keep Big Food's products within the healthy range.
Since the word ""healthy"" can no longer be trusted, here are some other words that people see at the supermarket often but can be deceiving: wholesome, natural, and nutritious. None of these terms are officially defined by the FDA and are therefore used on a range of very unwholesome, unnatural, and innutritious foods.
When it comes to health, the FDA doesn't have Americans' best interests in mind, meaning that consumers must do their own research if they hope to eat and drink products that might actually benefit them.

35,﻿tron-02215,Vice Presidential Candidate John Edwards responsible for the flu vaccine shortage?,"Flu Shot Info /Interesting, read to end
How the vaccine works:
Influenza vaccine is produced by growing the virus in eggs. The virus is killed and processed to create the vaccine, which is given by injection under the skin. The body then produces antibodies to the virus over the next two to four weeks. If the immunized person then comes into contact with the influenza virus, the antibodies attack and kill the virus before it has a chance to cause infection. The vaccine contains the 3 most likely strains to be active during the “flu season”
Why the shortage:
Almost half of the nation’s flu vaccine will not be delivered this year. Chiron, a major manufacturer of flu vaccine, will not be distributing any influenza vaccine this flu season. Chiron was to make 46-48 million doses of vaccine for the United States. Chiron is a British company. Recently British health officials stopped Chiron from distributing and making the vaccine when inspectors found unsanitary conditions in the labs. Some lots of the vaccine were recalled and destroyed.
Why is our vaccine made in the UK and not the US?
The major pharmaceutical companies in the US provided almost 90% of the nations flu vaccine at one time. They did this despite a very low profit margin for the product. Basically, they were doing us a favor.
In the late 80’s a man from North Carolina who had received the vaccine got the flu. The strain he caught was one of the strains in that years vaccine made by a US company. What did he do?

How the vaccine works:
Influenza vaccine is produced by growing the virus in eggs.
The virus is killed and processed to create the vaccine, which is given by injection under the skin.
The body then produces antibodies to the virus over the next two to four weeks.
If the immunized person then comes into contact with the influenza virus, the antibodies attack and kill the virus before it has a chance to cause infection.
The vaccine contains the 3 most likely strains to be active during the “flu season”
Why the shortage:
Almost half of the nation’s flu vaccine will not be delivered this year.
Chiron, a major manufacturer of flu vaccine, will not be distributing any influenza vaccine this flu season.
Chiron was to make 46-48 million doses of vaccine for the United States.
Chiron is a British company.
Recently British health officials stopped Chiron from distributing and making the vaccine when inspectors found unsanitary conditions in the labs.
Some lots of the vaccine were recalled and destroyed.
Why is our vaccine made in the UK and not the US?
The major pharmaceutical companies in the US provided almost 90% of the nations flu vaccine at one time.
They did this despite a very low profit margin for the product.
Basically, they were doing us a favor.
In the late 80’s a man from North Carolina who had received the vaccine got the flu.

36,﻿snes-00512,The National Cancer Institute has admitted that cannabis kills cancer,"POSTED ONSUN, AUG 23RD, 2015 BY RMUSE
The U.S. Government's Department of Health Finally Admits That Marijuana Kills
Throughout history the main reasons human beings willfully kill other human beings are religion and greed. Although it is surprising that people steeped in a religion that worships a ""loving god"" revels in killing other humans, it is part of the ""convert or kill"" mindset that one the major Abrahamic religions, Christianity thrives and prospers on. It is not as surprising that human beings kill others out of greed, but for an industry that claims it exists to ""save lives and heal infirmity,"" it is astonishing that the pursuit of profit drives their pursuit of death and sickness. For the medical industrial complex, there is nothing as terrifying as a cure, or remedy, for a highly profitable and fatal disease like cancer.
It is little surprise that for a couple of decades at the direction of the multi-national pharmaceutical industry, and more recently the for-profit prison and law enforcement industry, the federal government and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have concealed a highly effective and completely natural remedy and relief for cancer. In just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy. In fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.
What is even more encouraging is that although the NIH has known for a long time, with mountains of empirical evidence, that the compounds in marijuana, cannabinoids (delta-9 THC and cannabidiol [CBD]), are effective at killing cancer cells, they have discovered how it happens. After preaching since the 1970s that marijuana had absolutely no medicinal effect or value for human beings, and putting the weed in the same classification as heroin, the Department of Health's National Cancer Institute is now ""advising that cannabinoids are useful in treating cancer and its side effects by smoking, eating it in a baked product, drinking herbal teas, or even spraying it under the tongue.""  The U.S. Department of Health also made a partial list of other highly-beneficial medicinal uses of marijuana such as reducing anti-inflammatory activity, blocking cancerous cell growth,  relieving muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis sufferers, as an effective anti-viral agent, an anti-bacterial and preventing the growth of blood vessels that supply tumors.
Some of the other NIH studies have shown that cannabinoids reduce the risk of colon cancer, and are effective in its treatment. One study revealed that delta-9-THC killed or damaged hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and killed cancer molecules in ""non-small cell lung and breast cancer cells."" One specific study of cannabidiol (CBD) in estrogen receptors showed ""it caused cancer cell death while having no effect on normal, healthy breast cells."" Even in advanced cancer stages where it was not diagnosed early, when given as a supplement with chemotherapy, CBD and THC greatly enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy as well as restoring appetite and relieving nausea.
Obviously with cancer as a major killer of Americans, its treatment is big business and even bigger money for the pharmaceutical industry and ""treatment centers."" As many people have rightly suspected for years, the cure for cancer, or even a more effective and less-stressful treatment regimen, has been held hostage by powerful entities just so the pharmaceutical and hospital industry can continue to raking in hundreds-of-billions of dollars a year to ""fight the disease"" with radiation, pills, and numerous and endless surgical procedures. For example, on its own, the National Cancer Institute has taken in and spent over $90 billion allegedly trying to find a cure for cancer. The abomination is that the organization knew all along that a profuse amount of well-documented scientific studies proved that a 3,000 year-old ""medicinal weed"" any American could grow in their garden was effectively killing cancer cells, shrinking malignant tumors, and relieving the effects of the disease. Cannabis is also proven to reduce opioid (painkiller) usage by an average of 47% that drug companies could not allow to become common knowledge. It is likely why the reports that the NIH, Health Department, and National Cancer Center began advising of the weed's benefits was only in British media, but not America.
There was hardly any reporting in June that President Obama eased restrictions on further and more comprehensive cannabis research by eliminating a major roadblock to open up substantial research on the weed's medical value when it removed <i>""additional review""<i> of the Public Health Service (PHS). The last thing the law enforcement and highly-profitable prison industry wanted was for marijuana's medicinal value to become public knowledge and face public pressure to decriminalize the weed. There is too much money in incarcerating Americans for using a weed for recreation that may also relieve a plethora of infirmities. As much as the pharmaceutical industrial complex wants to continue getting extremely rich off of slowly killing cancer patients with ineffective and expensive treatments, the law enforcement industry thrives on the continued criminalization of a common weed.
What is appalling really, especially for those who have witnessed or experienced firsthand the horrible suffering of cancer patients, is that there have been several scientific studies over the past twenty years, at least, that produced empirical data proving the effectiveness of cannabinoids in killing cancer. Still, because there is huge money in perpetuating the disease with ineffective drugs, fraudulent treatment centers, and manufacturing radiological machines it took until this past April for the United States government's National Institute on Drug Abuse to revise their publications and admit the many, many benefits of cannabis for medicinal use.
It is likely that every American in this country has known, or lost, a loved one to the horrid disease and it is absolutely despicable, and frankly evil, that the medical industry helped keep an incredibly inexpensive and highly-effective cancer-killing drug out of reach. It is unclear who in government is responsible for helping conceal the now-proven medicinal benefits of weed, or who in government revealed that for at least a decade the National Institutes of Health and Department of Health have known that instead of being a <i>""dangerous drug""<i> like heroin, marijuana kills cancer cells and dog forbid may put a smile on a cancer patient's face. Marijuana may not be a miracle drug, but with every new revelation that it does so much more than make a user hungry, tired or laugh it is easy to comprehend why every American is not growing and benefitting from its incredible health benefits; keeping it illegal is making the pharmaceutical industrial complex and prison industry incredibly rich while people are suffering and dying.","anger </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> bolded,  underline or italicized </s> emotional appeals </s> Inappropriate Use of Scientific and Other Evidence - out of context_verified </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> financial motivation </s> inappropriate use of scientific and Other evidence </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility",false,"The National Cancer Institute has admitted that cannabis kills cancer </s> It is little surprise that for a couple of decades at the direction of the multi-national pharmaceutical industry, and more recently the for-profit prison and law enforcement industry, the federal government and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have concealed a highly effective and completely natural remedy and relief for cancer.

The FDA is warning pasta and pizza lovers that cheese labeled ""100 percent Parmesan"" are often filled with cheese substitutes-like wood pulp.
Yes, you've been eating wood, thanks to companies like Castle Cheese, which produced Parmesan cheese containing no actual Parmesan for almost 30 years. The president of the company, which supplied megastores like Target, is scheduled to plead guilty this month to charges that carry a sentence of up to a year in prison and a $100,o00 fine, according to Bloomberg.
Neil Schuman-who runs Arthur Shcuman Inc. the largest seller of hard Italian cheese in the U.S.-estimates a whopping 20 percent of such cheese are mislabeled.
Bloomberg ran experiments on store-bought grated cheese to test for wood pulp content in a lab and found that many cheeses have cellulose, which is made from wood pulp. Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, from Jewel-Osco, contained 8.8 percent cellulose. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese had 7.8 percent cellulose. Whole Foods 365 brand didn't list cellulose as an ingredient, and tested at 0.3 percent. Kraft had 3.8 percent cellulose.

'But I realised that couldn't have been it, because it was evenly distributed over my whole ankle and foot.'
After attempts to stop the bleeding were unsuccessful, the teenager spent his weekend at two different hospitals, where doctors also tried and failed to stop the sores from bleeding.
One nurse advised the bites could be from sea lice, but it was no more than a 'guess'.
What are sea lice? 
Sea lice which cause tiny, pin-prick like bites are a miniscule jellyfish or stinger larvae.
They have the same stinging cells as an adult jellyfish, though they can only attack a small area because of their size

46,﻿snes-01965,"A man in Stockholm, Sweden died from a fat embolism after undergoing penis enlargement surgery.","Man dies from penis enlargement surgery in first ever fatal case
The first case of a man killed by penis enlargement surgery has been reported in Sweden.
A healthy 30-year-old had wanted to increase both the girth and length of his genitals using a process where fat is transferred from his stomach.
Plastic surgeons first carried out the elongation, which involves making an incision to loosen a ligament at the base of the penis.
They then began the enlargement and had planned to inject two fluid ounces of fat cells.
Yet, before they finished the injection, his heart began racing, his oxygen levels fell, and his blood pressure dropped, and he then suffered a heart attack, reports the Journal of Forensic Sciences.
Doctors performed CPR and sent the man to an emergency room, but he died less than two hours later. 
The patient, who had mild asthma, but otherwise no past medical history, died from a fat embolism, the report's authors state.
This occurs when fat tissue passes into the bloodstream and lodges within the blood vessels of the lung and other sites, resulting in respiratory failure. 
The paper states that 'penile elongation and enlargement is considered to be a simple and safe procedure' but warns that complications may be higher when both procedures are combined. 
While this is the first reported death from this kind of surgery, experts say it often leads to other serious problems.
'It's a completely useless procedure that never works and disfigures men, and could kill you,' urologist Tobias Kohler of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota told BuzzFeed News. 
He said: 'This is the worst case, but there are lots of other horrible consequences, from disfigurement to permanent erectile disfunction to even worse.' 
Disappointing results 
Furthermore, one expert has warned that the risks are not worth taking and results are often disappointing. 
Sexual medicine consultant Professor Kevan Wylie said studies that followed men up over a longer time suggest disappointing results, with complications including disfigurement, scarring, lumpiness and infection.
He says the use of biodegradable frames has had better results than fat injection, reports the NHS. 
Professor Wylie said: 'The problem with injecting fat is that over time, the body will re-absorb the fat which can result in a return to the penis' original size.'
He adds that penis enlargements can result in an average gain in length to the flaccid penis of 2cm, but there will be no change to the size of the erect penis.
Furthermore, the erect penis will not point as high as before the surgery because the ligament which was cut no longer offers support.
'A lot of men who have this treatment don't truly appreciate this loss of angle,' says Professor Wylie. 
'It can make sex quite uncomfortable. You've got to do a lot more manoeuvring with your partner. The advantage of a 2cm gain in flaccid length is far outweighed by the loss of angle of erection.' 
WHAT IS PENOPLASTY?
Increasing the girth of a penis is called lipofilling, which involves injecting fat from a patient's stomach or legs into the genitals - adding one inch in circumference. 
Doctors can also utilise platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - which is commonly used in facial rejuvenation - to increase a penis's girth.
PRP involves taking blood from the patient - with the plasma and platelets enriched with growth factors, and mixing it with fat.
Penoplasty procedures to increase girth start from £4,500 ($6,400).
Meanwhile, penoplasty procedures for increased girth and length starts from £6,500 ($9,250).
Furthermore, the PRP treatment is an additional £800 ($1,140) and bank storage of fat for top-up procedures £1,800 ($2,561).
Yet, procedures to increase girth may only last up to a few years, experts have warned.",Narrative with Details </s> Narrative with details_details verified to be true </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> uppercase words </s> Establishing Legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified,true,"A man in Stockholm, Sweden died from a fat embolism after undergoing penis enlargement surgery. </s> Man dies from penis enlargement surgery in first ever fatal case

47,﻿snes-03675,The Amish don't get autism because they do not vaccinate their children.,"The Age of Autism: The Amish anomaly
By DAN OLMSTED
   
LANCASTER, Pa., April 18 (UPI) -- Part 1 of 2. Where are the autistic Amish? Here in Lancaster County, heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, there should be well over 100 with some form of the disorder.
I have come here to find them, but so far my mission has failed, and the very few I have identified raise some very interesting questions about some widely held views on autism.
The mainstream scientific consensus says autism is a complex genetic disorder, one that has been around for millennia at roughly the same prevalence. That prevalence is now considered to be 1 in every 166 children born in the United States.
Applying that model to Lancaster County, there ought to be 130 Amish men, women and children here with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Well over 100, in rough terms.
Typically, half would harbor milder variants such as Asperger's Disorder or the catch-all Pervasive Development Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified -- PDD-NOS for short.
So let's drop those from our calculation, even though ""mild"" is a relative term when it comes to autism.
That means upwards of 50 Amish people of all ages should be living in Lancaster County with full-syndrome autism, the ""classic autism"" first described in 1943 by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner at Johns Hopkins University. The full-syndrome disorder is hard to miss, characterized by ""markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests,"" according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
Why bother looking for them among the Amish? Because they could hold clues to the cause of autism.
The first half-dozen articles in this ongoing series on the roots and rise of autism examined the initial studies and early accounts of the disorder, first identified by Kanner among 11 U.S. children born starting in 1931.
Kanner wrote that his 1938 encounter with a child from Mississippi, identified as Donald T., ""made me aware of a behavior pattern not known to me or anyone else theretofore."" Kanner literally wrote the book on ""Child Psychiatry,"" published in 1934.
If Kanner was correct -- if autism was new and increasingly prevalent -- something must have happened in the 1930s to trigger those first autistic cases. Genetic disorders do not begin suddenly or increase dramatically in prevalence in a short period of time.
That is why it is worth looking for autistic Amish -- to test reasoning against reality. Largely cut off for hundreds of years from American culture and scientific progress, the Amish might have had less exposure to some new factor triggering autism in the rest of population.
Surprising, but no one seems to have looked.
Of course, the Amish world is insular by nature; finding a small subset of Amish is a challenge by definition. Many Amish, particularly Old Order, ride horse-and-buggies, eschew electricity, do not attend public school, will not pose for pictures and do not chat casually with the ""English,"" as they warily call the non-Amish.
Still, some Amish today interact with the outside world in many ways. Some drive, use phones, see doctors and send out Christmas cards with family photos. They all still refer to themselves as ""Plain,"" but the definition of that word varies quite a bit.
So far, from sources inside and outside the Amish community, I have identified three Amish residents of Lancaster County who apparently have full-syndrome autism, all of them children.
A local woman told me there is one classroom with about 30 ""special-needs"" Amish children. In that classroom, there is one autistic Amish child.
Another autistic Amish child does not go to school.
The third is that woman's pre-school-age daughter.
If there were more, she said, she would know it.
What I learned about those children is the subject of the next column.

The Case for Cashews
Two handfuls of cashews each day may keep depression at bay. A growing body of research has found that in lieu of taking a prescription drug, some people can turn to foods that are high in tryptophans, like cashews. Depressive episodes are often triggered when the body drops in serotonin and tryptophans can boost it again, but people tend to turn to nutrition as a last resort. One more natural source of tryptophan is cashews. ""Several handfuls of cashews provide 1,000-2,000 milligrams of tryptophan, which will work as well as prescription antidepressants,"" says Dr. Andrew Saul, a therapeutic nutritionist and editor-in-chief of Orthomolecular Medicine News Service. The body turns tryptophan into serotonin, a major contributor to feelings of sexual desire, good mood, and healthy sleep.

The high levels of magnesium and vitamin B6 found in cashews may also help to stabilize mood. Approximately five ounces of cashews a day will provide a middle-aged man with his daily-required magnesium intake, a nutrient that, when low, can trigger mild depression. Vitamin B6 lends a hand to converting tryptophan into serotonin and helps magnesium enter into the body's cells. It's likely a trio of nutrients that help with depression. ""You don't want to think that one individual nutrient is the magic bullet,"" says Saul.

""Several handfuls of cashews provide 1,000-2,000 milligrams of tryptophan, which will work as well as prescription antidepressants,"" says Dr. Andrew Saul, a therapeutic nutritionist and editor-in-chief of Orthomolecular Medicine News Service.
The body turns tryptophan into serotonin, a major contributor to feelings of sexual desire, good mood, and healthy sleep.
The high levels of magnesium and vitamin B6 found in cashews may also help to stabilize mood.
Approximately five ounces of cashews a day will provide a middle-aged man with his daily-required magnesium intake, a nutrient that, when low, can trigger mild depression.
Vitamin B6 lends a hand to converting tryptophan into serotonin and helps magnesium enter into the body's cells.
It's likely a trio of nutrients that help with depression.
""You don't want to think that one individual nutrient is the magic bullet,"" says Saul.
